            city of Seattle, then reviews her correspondence with friends and family and lists
            the contents of a package she plans to send to her mother. </p>

            Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a
            coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians"
            and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909
            Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle
            World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on
            Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story
            buildings.

            Gladys says that she is not going to Alaska because staterooms for the voyage are
            in such high demand.  She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then talks about
            her travel companion Mrs. Hughes.  She particularly describes Mrs. Hughes' famous
            cousins Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and
            now-deceased husband.

            Gladys tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
            a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news
            or gossip 
            of friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other individuals;

            Writing from El Paso, Gladys evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
            and fiance, as well as Gladys's experience with head lice, which she 
            picked up in Mexico. Gladys also explains to her mother that she is 
            staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
            witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
            explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz, 
            Vice-President Reyes, and the general populace. Though Gladys is 
            definitely writing from El Paso, her exact location within the city 
            is unknown. Her letter is on stationary from the Office of the Treasurer
            in Santa Cruz, California, but the postmark indicates she mailed the 
            letter from El Paso. In her letter, she mentions how her Uncle wants
            her to extend her stay in El Paso, which suggests she might be staying
            with him, but then she discusses her extensive time spent with Adelaide,
            which suggests she is staying with her.

Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume The Yellowstone Park, Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes &#34;tourist transportation&#34; through the park as &#34;mostly by coach, ordinarily with four horses each&#34; (203). He comments that these coaches were a &#34;necessity&#34; because &#34;The points of interest are so scattered&#34; (274). Department of the Interior, U.S. National Park Service.

It was torn down in 1930, at which point the log columns that Gladys describes had been damaged beyond repair by insects. The Forestry Building is described in detail on the University of Washington Library's Special Collections web site as being &#34;sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior spaces evoked the majesty of Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally, implied the great potential wealth they contained.&#34; University of Washington Library, Special Collections"><sup>4</sup></a>

            We arrived in Seattle
            <br><a name="0004"></a>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            at 7.30 this morning.  It was
            <br><a name="0005"></a>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            rather rough last night, but
            <br><a name="0006"></a>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            it was just from the wind.

            It was the only rough place we

            had coming back.  We had a

            <br><a name="0013"></a>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            was posted by the Purser, and
            <br><a name="0014"></a>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he gave it to me.<a name="pPurser" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nPurser" class="annotation" title="The Purser on a cruise ship traditionally has several important responsibilities. They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit and bringing them aboard. The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations. Their duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the Purser. target=&#34;#MarineWatch&#34;"><sup>9</sup></a>

A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle in 1909. Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition. Some of the postcards are in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others are in black and white. It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens to mail one."><sup>10</sup></a>

         <p class="msDesc">This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead
            stationery
            measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The
            front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
            body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
            The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring
            approximately
            2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS
            |
            PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
            corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted
            that other letters
            in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from
            the same hotel, are 
            likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's
            excursion to Alaska,
            the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration
            rather than a photo, and depicts
            the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side
            of the building. 
            The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style
            than the slanted script)
            and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's
            names are printed
            ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under
            the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
            The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"),
            and so
            Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of
            center, inside the
            bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within
            the boundaries of the 
            letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style
            (some page numbers are followed
            by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>
         <div class="envelope">Accompanied by a stamped, cancelled, cream-colored envelope of Hotel Georgian stationery
            measuring 6.5 x 3.625 inches. A 1.375 x 2.4375-inch photographed image of the Hotel
            Georgian facade is printed on the left-hand side of the envelope above the hotel's
            address.  Incidentally, the image of the hotel on the envelope corresponds with the
            
            image of the hotel facade on the outdated Hotel Georgian stationery.  The stamp is
            also upside down.<br><br> [<a HREF="./08-08-1909_to_ATS_envelope.jpg" alt="Envelope for letter of 8 August 1909" target="blank">Envelope</a>].

Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after the ceremony Holt 238."><sup>22</sup></a> Things are

         <p class="msDesc"> ALS. Two loose sheets of cream-colored Office of the Treasurer, Santa Cruz County,
            California
            letterhead stationary measuring 8.56 x 11 inches. The front of each sheet of letterhead
            contains
            a 2.125 x 2 inch black and white image of a building in the upper left corner of the
            page and 
            an image of flowers with a scroll bearing the words "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CALIFORNIA,"
            along with
            a medallion emblazoned with the words "Office of Treasurer." The combined image of
            the scroll, 
            flowers, and medallion measures 2.125 x 4.25 inches. Underneath the image is text
            that reads 
            "W.H. BIAS Treasurer" and "R.W. BIAS Deputy Treas.," followed by a line for the date
            partially
            pre-printed as "________ / 1___." The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, though there
            is some
            reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive.
            The paper has 
            light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides
            and that are 
            0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting
            3.063 inches
            from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet.
            On the 
            back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue
            until 0.1875 inches
            from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets
            were placed 
            together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin,
            but not overly
            fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND."
            When viewing 
            the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.</p>

            by a stamped, cancelled, dark cream-colored envelope made from heavy paper and measuring

            inches 
            of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG
            RAFT 
            COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark
            is
            from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens, 
            26 Emerson Street, Newton, Massachusets." There is an additional endorsement on the
            envelop in a different
            hand than the written address of a circled 10, then a 9/25. The 25 is also circled.

                  Observation Wagon,"</q> which was a type of stagecoach used to take visitors on a
               <q>"Grand Loop"</q> of Yellowstone Park. Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park
               Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern
               Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth
               Hot
               Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume <cite>The Yellowstone Park</cite>,
               Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes <q>"tourist
                  transportation"</q> through the park as <q>"mostly by coach, ordinarily with four
                  horses each"</q> (203). He comments that these coaches were a <q>"necessity"</q>
               because <q>"The points of interest are so scattered"</q> (274).

               concluded.  It was torn down in 1930, at which point the log columns that Gladys describes
               had been damaged beyond repair by insects.  The Forestry Building is described in
               detail on the University of Washington Library's Special Collections web site as being
               <q>"sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest
                  resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed
                  the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin
                  idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis
                  (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior
                  spaces evoked the majesty of Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally,
                  implied the great potential wealth they contained."</q>

               They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both
               the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit

               of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes

               mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.
               A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which
               are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature
               various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition
               in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for
               the event, amateur photographers
               were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and
               so several different individuals
               and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are
               in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others 
               are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to
               her aunt from Seattle
               is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade
               of the twentieth century, but were actually
               banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been
               one of the last citizens

               Since the French Revolution in the 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered effeminate.
               Though JJM is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can see
               how the dominant culture would have found dancing
               in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside
               women through ballroom dancing. We 
               do not know if he only attended these gatherings with his male friends or if women
               would join their group, but in the following 
               lines of JJM's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him
               about being a <q>"better boy"</q>. He seems to be 
               referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party

               States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, Emily Holt's 1901
               <cite>Encyclopaedia of Etiquette</cite> allows "brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly
               from the altar to a train or boat" to "wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade
               of blue" (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this 
               in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of "the chief adjuncts of this toilette" (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this 
               letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be
               preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she
               and her husband 
               immediately depart after the ceremony (Holt 238).<a href="#pWedding" class="annotation">

               A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves
               from job to job. 
               In <cite>The Engineers' Review</cite> volume 16 (1905), I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
               engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two
               jobs, even 
               though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
                  They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> (
               Lloyd 18). The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that 
               he is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909,
               
               he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer from the <em>Santa Clara</em> to the <em>Northwestern</em>. 
               Later in the current letter (04 October 1909), he details the number of the <em>Santa Clara</em>'s 
               engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications
               and boiler operation.

               article laments the Alaskan Indians' <q>scant regard for the ritual of the old tradition</q> of 
               totem-making and relates the need for <q>funds for the preservation of these monuments</q> 
               ("Deserted Totems of Alaska").  [<a HREF="http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&amp;CISOPTR=9786&amp;REC=1" alt="Photograph of totems at old Tuxekan, Alaska's Digital Archives and Alaska State Library" target="blank">Totems at old Tuxekan</a>].

               <q>[T]he first cannery in Alaska was built [in Klawock] by a San Francisco firm in 1878.</q> 
               Until 1920, it remained the only salmon cannery in the state (
               "Visitor Information"). McIntyre may intend for his involvement with what at the time 
               was leading industrialization to impress Gladys, as he later takes a boastful tone
               when explaining 
               the specifications of the Northwestern in comparison to other ships.

               A promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship Company describes Ketchikan
               as 
               a tourist destination, and the waterfalls represent not only the leisure of sightseeing
               but
               also the rapid growth and modernization of Ketchikan's infrastructure. <q>The city has run 
                  pipes to the falls of the Ketchikan river which gives the citizens an opportunity
                  to procure 
                  water direct from this cold and refreshing stream. It is said to be the best system
                  in Alaska. 
                  Ketchikanites need have no fears of disease germs lurking in their drinking water.</q> McIntyre 
               and Palmer likely took what the guide calls <q>a jaunt of two miles along the Ketchikan River to 
                  the city's intake,</q> where <q>[a] walk has been built near the bank of this winding stream and the tourist 
                  wends his way among the timber until the first falls are reached</q> (<cite>A 
                  Trip to Wonderful Alaska</cite>).

               Here McIntyre seems to be referring to the boat on which he's currently sailing to
               catch up 
               with the Northwestern. The diminutive connotation fits with the boastful tone that
               he has 
               assumed to impress Gladys with the size and power of the Northwestern. Interestingly,
               the 
               term soap box hasn't yet entered common usage as a way of designating a smaller, unpowered 
               or low-power vehicle. It's possible that the "soap box" is a lightboat, which appears
               in the 
               closer to McIntyre's letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909.

               <cite>The Locomotive</cite> reports that on 11 March 
               1909, <q>[a] boiler exploded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the steamer Weitchpec</q> 
               and <q>Fireman Elmer Dennis was fatally scalded</q> ("March, 1909" 
               171). The serious and fatal nature of boiler accidents is clearly conveyed in 
               the volume's sizeable monthly catalogues. Additionally, a 1916 issue of <cite>The 
                  Popular Science Monthly</cite> laments that <q>[a]t present the life of coal-passers and engineers 
                  is one of extreme hazard.</q> To maintain pressure in the various compartments in the engine room, 
               <q>it is necessary for the men to enter or leave by means of air locks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This method
                  of entrance 
                  and exit is, therefore, very slow, and should the compartment become suddenly filled
                  
                  with steam or noxious gases, all the men at work could not gain the outer air in time
                  
                  to save their lives</q> ("Saving Men from 
               Scalding Steam in Steamship Engine Rooms" 254).

               The September 23 issue of <cite>The Seattle Star</cite> 
               reports that <q>a big Pope-Toledo automobile crashed through the bridge railing at Fourth av. S. 
                  and Lane st. shortly before 6 o'clock this morning.</q> It <q>crashed to 
                  the tideflats below</q> and <q>turned turtle, pinning its occupants beneath.</q> The auxiliary gas tank 
               caught fire upon the vehicle's crash. The driver, Henry Hiser, <q>managed to extricate himself</q> and 
               another passenger, but he <q>scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest</q> (
               "Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance"). 
               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Seattle Republican</cite> 
               further explains that Hiser <q>hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long</q> 
               and <q>drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to
                  the city at 
                  a speed of a mile a minute</q> ("Henry Hiser"). McIntyre 
               seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to
               Gladys of 13 August 
               1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance
               of the idea 
               of Gladys spending time with the drinking <q>Class.</q>

               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Leavenworth Echo</cite> 
               reports that <q>a Wallingford Avenue street car in Seattle jumped the track on a curve near the main
                  
                  gate of the [Alaska-Yukon Pacific] exposition. One man was killed, fifty five injured.
                  It was the 
                  first serious street car accident since the exposition opened</q> (
               "News of Pacific Northwest"). Drawing from contemporary articles in <cite>
                  The Seattle Times</cite> and <cite>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite>, Stein corroborates that 
               <q>[o]n September 24, 1909, a Seattle Electric Company streetcar jumps the track at the
                  
                  corner of E 40th Street and 14th Avenue NE (later University Way). The streetcar crashes
                  
                  into three concession buildings across the street from the main entrance of the 
                  Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. One passenger, Frank Hull of Tacoma, is killed, 
                  and 55 men, women, and children are injured</q> (Stein).
