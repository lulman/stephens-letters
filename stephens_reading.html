            Writing from Seattle, Stephens describes the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and the
            city of Seattle, then reviews her correspondence with friends and family and lists
            the contents of a package she plans to send to her mother.

            Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a
            coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians"
            and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909
            Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle
            World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on
            Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story
            buildings.

            Gladys says that she is not going to Alaska because staterooms for the voyage are
            in such high demand.  She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then talks about
            her travel companion Mrs. Hughes.  She particularly describes Mrs. Hughes' famous
            cousins Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and
            now-deceased husband.

            a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news
            or gossip 
            of friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other individuals;

            Writing from El Paso, Gladys evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
            and fiance, as well as Gladys's experience with head lice, which she 
            picked up in Mexico. Gladys also explains to her mother that she is 
            staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
            witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
            explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz, 
            Vice-President Reyes, and the general populace. Though Gladys is 
            definitely writing from El Paso, her exact location within the city 
            is unknown. Her letter is on stationary from the Office of the Treasurer
            in Santa Cruz, California, but the postmark indicates she mailed the 
            letter from El Paso. In her letter, she mentions how her Uncle wants
            her to extend her stay in El Paso, which suggests she might be staying
            with him, but then she discusses her extensive time spent with Adelaide,
            which suggests she is staying with her.

            <br>Dear Mama,
            
            
            <p>
               I have made my 
               
               first trip to the Exposition 
               Grounds. They are simply
               dreams of beauty. Such 
               flowers—and such 
               quantities of them! There 
               is one place where there 
               are thousands and 
               thousands of white, 
               lavender and pure yellow 
               pansies. In one place 
               there are veritable terraces 
               of water with a falls between 
               This expanse is surrounded 
               by the most beautiful
               display of poppies I ever 
               
               
               saw. Then there are
               flowers like those I brought
               home from Senior Prom.—
               
               gerhaniums—<U>dwarf</U>
               sweet peas—every kind
               of flowers imaginable.
               Talk about roses, there
               are so many here that
               I can't think what
               California will be like.
               I went today with
               the Virginians. The men
               were hunting up old
               friends here in the
               city. I have a lot of
               truck, which I am going
               to send by mail. There
               are four pictures of
               Yellowstone which are
               exquisite—they are
               as natural as pictures
               can be. My Princetonian
               
               got them for me, and
               
               
               paid a dollar for
               them. The packages of tea
               I got at the Japanese
               tea garden from the
               little Japanese girl. I
               
               ordered (through Hayden)
               a 5 cent can of condense
               milk.

               The buildings are  [fine?] 
               at the fair. One of the
               Virginian ladies said
               this fair is much superior
               
               to the St. Louis and others
               because of its compactness
               as well as its beauty.
               The buildings will be
               used later as college b'l'd'gs.
               Today we only visited
               
               those in the inner circle.
               The place is laid out in
               this way

               <U>3</U>
               8.25. We went to
               the Expo. at 10.30—got
               back at 4.40. Some day
               we are going up Puget
               Sound. I can do quite
               a stunt at eating now—
               devoured a small steak for
               my breakfast—a dish of
               strawberries, one of oatmeal,
               two muffins and three
               pancakes—and a cup of
               coffee. Sunburn is wearing
               off a trifle since I have
               left the park. They have a
               line of cable cars here, and
               some odd big ones. The
               population has increased
               150,000 in 2 years.
               
               I am getting to be
               quite a critic on buildings
               with two builders.

               Havent done much on
               the writing stunt. I
               wrote Miss Childs a
               steamer letter, one to
               Gus, I think I wrote
               one to Roswel, and a
               dozen lines to Nat
               telling him that I
               was having a dandy
               time—never knew
               where I was going next
               and did not know
               when I'd be home;
               and hoped that he'd
               have as pleasant a
               summer as I was
               having. Found nothing
               at the P.O. Gee! but
               I'd like to hear. Will
               probably be here until
               
               the 20th perhaps
               the 24th. Am not sure

            <p>
               I do not know
               what day we will leave
               here, but we'll leave soon.
               Will return to El Paso
               by way of California.
               I am decidedly  [tanned?] 
               from riding up on the
               top seat with the driver
               in Yellowstone Park.
               I drove the coach 3
               days. There were 4
               horses and the coach
               weighs 2400 lbs. It was
               against the rules, but
               the driver let me.<a name="pStagecoach" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nStagecoach" class="annotation" title="Gladys most likely drove a 4-horse &#34;Yellowstone Observation Wagon,&#34; which was a type of stagecoach used to take visitors on a &#34;Grand Loop&#34; of Yellowstone Park. Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume The Yellowstone Park, Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes &#34;tourist transportation&#34; through the park as &#34;mostly by coach, ordinarily with four horses each&#34; (203). He comments that these coaches were a &#34;necessity&#34; because &#34;The points of interest are so scattered&#34; (274). Department of the Interior, U.S. National Park Service.

                When
               we met another coach
               
               or any soldiers the
               driver took the reins.
               Talk about sore arms!
               And my nose, oh my
               nose! It was terribly
               burned, looked just
               like a beet. It has
               pealed [sic]  now and begins
               to look more respectable.

It was torn down in 1930, at which point the log columns that Gladys describes had been damaged beyond repair by insects. The Forestry Building is described in detail on the University of Washington Library's Special Collections web site as being &#34;sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior spaces evoked the majesty of Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally, implied the great potential wealth they contained.&#34; University of Washington Library, Special Collections"><sup>3</sup></a>

               the 23 of Aug. I
               got it this morning. It is
               a beauty.

               Oh about the
               pillow. Mrs. L.  was 
               much pleased
               with it and thought
               it handsome and
               it is in the
               parlour.
               
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               I do hope that
               I'll get a letter
               tomorrow.

            <br>Mother Dear,
            
            
            <p>
               We arrived in Seattle
               at 7:20 this morning.  It was
               rather rough last night, but
               it was just from the wind.
               It was the only rough place we
               had coming back.  We had a 
               dandy time coming back.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
               As a souvenir I have the
               official list of the passangers
               who sailed from Seattle.  It
               was posted by the Purser, and
               he gave it to me.<a name="pPurser" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nPurser" class="annotation" title="The Purser on a cruise ship traditionally has several important responsibilities. They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit and bringing them aboard. The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations. Their duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the Purser. target=&#34;#MarineWatch&#34;"><sup>8</sup></a>

               I'd like to know what is
               the matter with auntie.  I
               sent her cards from Yellowstone
               and some from here — among 
               them a leather A.Y.P. card.<a name="pcard" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ncard" class="annotation" title="The &#34;A.Y.P. cards&#34; Gladys mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition. A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle in 1909. Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition. Some of the postcards are in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others are in black and white. It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens to mail one."><sup>9</sup></a>

         <p class="msDesc">This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead
            stationery
            measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The
            front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
            body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
            The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring
            approximately
            2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS
            |
            PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
            corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted
            that other letters
            in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from
            the same hotel, are 
            likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's
            excursion to Alaska,
            the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration
            rather than a photo, and depicts
            the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side
            of the building. 
            The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style
            than the slanted script)
            and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's
            names are printed
            ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under
            the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
            The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"),
            and so
            Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of
            center, inside the
            bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within
            the boundaries of the 
            letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style
            (some page numbers are followed
            by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).

               good big baby, not a little 
               teeny weeny. You know I

               now that he is here I am glad 
               he is strong and perfect. If

               with her little brother and Willis is pleased 
               with his little son. I have only heard from 
               Gladys Stevens once. She was then in Colorado.
               I had hoped she would keep me posted as to 
               her travels. I suppose she will be home before 
               a great while now with many, many entertaining 
               things to tell you. I have thought of her very 
               often. Give my love to her when you see or write 
               her and tell her about my baby boy. You must 
               have missed her a very great deal. I hope you

                that I hated to leave Seattle on account
                of not being there when my letters
                arrived and again when I am at sea
                well I know where I am at
                least? I had two letters before sailing
                this time one Sunday and one Monday
                at  [5 p.m.?]  from a passanger that
                went north on this boat last
                Spring but which I did not talk
                to but twice but she had a notion
                or fancy but Neddie dear the 
                answers to both were the same
                and was this—<U>Impossible</U>

We do not know if he only attended these gatherings with his male friends or if women would join their group, but in the following lines of JJM's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him about being a &#34;better boy&#34;.

                is the habit of extracting misery

               Adelaide is getting some lovely
               things to be married in. She is having
               a pale blue broadcloth dress made. She
               has a handsome brown suit.<a name="pWedding" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nWedding" class="annotation" title="Though white wedding dresses were traditionally preferred in the United States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, Emily Holt's 1901 Encyclopaedia of Etiquette allows &#34;brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly from the altar to a train or boat&#34; to &#34;wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue&#34; (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of &#34;the chief adjuncts of this toilette&#34; (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after the ceremony Holt 238."><sup>21</sup></a> Things are

               I have found out some startling

               &amp; I made arrangements to go together
               this morning. What do you suppose
               the woman found--<U>bugs</U> in
               my head! I got them in Mexico.
               They all told me I'd be apt
               to get them. I thought I'd escaped
               however. Now what <U>do</U> you think
               of that. Well she worked good
               and hard and dosed my head and
               I have to go again Sat. morning.
               Their deposit was not large and
               so we have hopes of soon cleaning
               it all out. You can imagine
               how I feel. There isn't on the
               average one American in ten
               who goes there without getting
               loaded. Here's hoping I'll be clear

            is some
            reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive.
            The paper has 
            light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides
            and that are 
            0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting
            3.063 inches
            from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet.
            On the 
            back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue
            until 0.1875 inches
            from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets
            were placed 
            together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin,
            but not overly
            fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND."
            When viewing 
            the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.

            Envelope. 
             Accompanied
            by a stamped, cancelled, dark cream-colored envelope made from heavy paper and measuring
            5.875 x 3.5 inches.There is a printed black and white image measuring 2.75 x 1.875
            inches 
            of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG
            RAFT 
            COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark
            is
            from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens, 
            26 Emerson Street, Newton, Massachusets." There is an additional endorsement on the
            envelop in a different
            hand than the written address of a circled 10, then a 9/25. The 25 is also circled.
            The envelope
            is cleanly slit along the right edge.

               of the pictures. 
                
               They were taken 
               in San Diego

               was all I could 
               wear. There was

               once more I am writing on the last
               watch before arriving in port and in 
               the wee hours of the morning I promised
               my self to let you down easy this 
               time and not write so much but it
               promises to be a long watch for

               Elias by name. and a watch under
               a slow Bell is always a long one
               for me. I was just up stairs
               and it is a nasty rainy night
               and the ship is  [roaling?]  [sic] <a name="prolling" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nrolling" class="annotation" title="The swaying or rocking of a vessel from side to side.OED &#34;rolling&#34;"><sup>29</sup></a> heavy. you

               I wonder how you would fell [sic]

               mail for me and a dozen or two
               letters would be very nice to me but
               nothing doing untill [sic]  Seattle again!

                and It promises
               to be good. A few lines which I gave

               what's the odds where they came from?
               do you aggree [sic] with them.

               Clara's pictures but may next time I
               will not forget them any way when
               I have the time to get up town
               I have no pictures of my self but
               will have some some day and send
               you one If you wish and don't
               forget that I have only the postal
               which by the way is in use every
               day honey and many thanks for
               that pleasure but the original is
               what I wish to see above all else!
               
               Never satisfied am I honey

               any way it makes me seem closer
               to you anyway to be writing
               
               away and at the same time going
               farther &amp; farther away take notice
               I am always looking out for my own
               pleasure when at the same time I may
               be trying your patience severely

            <p>I had a great romp with little
                Gladys tonight her mother fetched
               her to my window (I have a room
               same as the chiefs on Santa Clara only
               the door opens in Engine room instead
               of deck) and she hollered for uncle that's
               what she calls me and I and I took her
               in side gave her an Orange  [dow?] 
               to the engine room and she was not
               a bit afraid and It was a pleasure
               two [sic]  have only a wee Gladys
               
               to talk to and I said lots
               of things to her about -O well-
               well she laughed and seemed to
               enjoy it any way although
               could not understand
               
            </p>
            
            <p>I almost believe honey that I 
               could carry you the same if
               the opportunity could be and your
               permission do you
               I often wonder If you give
               me  little thought when alone
               at night after a day of pleasure
               of pleasure (- I hope) remember
               dear I am going over the same
               old  [rout?]  nothing new and
               nothing to do but think which
               
               is not altogether unpleasant for
               neddy they are always  [of?]  you how
               glad I will be to get back to Seattle
               to get my letters so much seems to
               depend on them how I wished I
               knew what your mother said
               for I want to tell my mother
               all about you on my return
               but nothing to do but wait and
               wish for the best is they dear
               I forgot to tell you I gave up
               my room in Seattle also my friend

               well we arrived &amp; deaparted from ketchukam all OK and
               will be in Taku (you were there" about 630 and Should be in Juneau 930 a.m and leave for Skagway by 11 00
               then we go to Chilkoot for 3000 Cases of Salmon
               and then to Gypsum you remember the last place
               it is the place that we were agoing going to Stop at after leaving
               Sitka but for Some reason did not, from Gypsum
               to Ketchikan to Belling Run  and there Tacoma and me
               mither mother; we are having no end of fun this trip they was a
               boat lift Seattle the Same time we did and we have bin been racing
               all the way up this Companys boat too a freight boat
               we have accomadations for about &gt;5 passengers on this one
               and a fine passenger list we have this time a nice large
               healthy looking bunch but very quiet I have not
               bin been able to get of them to talk to me they seem afraid
               they are all Montana and are agoing going to Skaguay
               well we beat to Ketchkan about 3/4 of a hour but they
               had no Cargo for there So left ahead of us but they
               mit S.S. Dolphin and had to change Peluts pallets So we
               caught up with them and at it again we were
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Side by each for about 3 hours and they turned off
               and went another way they go direct to Skag and is
               45 or 50 miles farther than the way we are agoing going but
               we make 3 Stops So I do not know how we will
               make out but are doing our best the worst of it is I

               Joshing the Chief about the old freight boat he was on and
               if they beat us to Skag I will never hear the last of it

They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody Lloyd 18. The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that he is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909, he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer from the Santa Clara to the Northwestern. Later in the current letter (04 October 1909), he details the number of the Santa Clara's engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications and boiler operation."><sup>36</sup></a>

S. and Lane st. shortly before 6 o'clock this morning. It crashed to the tideflats below and turned turtle, pinning its occupants beneath. The auxiliary gas tank caught fire upon the vehicle's crash. The driver, Henry Hiser, managed to extricate himself and another passenger, but he scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance. The October 1 issue of The Seattle Republican further explains that Hiser hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long and drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to the city at a speed of a mile a minute Henry Hiser. McIntyre seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance of the idea of Gladys spending time with the drinking Class."><sup>42</sup></a>

            horizontally and would measure 1 inch vertically if the letters were not truncated.
            
            "Mills" measures roughly 3 inches by 1 inch.

                  Observation Wagon,"</q> which was a type of stagecoach used to take visitors on a
               <q>"Grand Loop"</q> of Yellowstone Park. Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park
               Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern
               Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth
               Hot
               Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume <cite>The Yellowstone Park</cite>,
               Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes <q>"tourist
                  transportation"</q> through the park as <q>"mostly by coach, ordinarily with four
                  horses each"</q> (203). He comments that these coaches were a <q>"necessity"</q>

               concluded.  It was torn down in 1930, at which point the log columns that Gladys describes
               had been damaged beyond repair by insects.  The Forestry Building is described in
               detail on the University of Washington Library's Special Collections web site as being
               <q>"sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest
                  resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed
                  the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin
                  idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis
                  (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior
                  spaces evoked the majesty of Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally,
                  implied the great potential wealth they contained."</q>

               They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both
               the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit
               and bringing them aboard.  The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs
               declarations.  Their duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward.  So,
               given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners

               mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.
               A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which
               are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature
               various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition
               in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for
               the event, amateur photographers
               were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and
               so several different individuals
               and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are
               in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others 
               are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to
               her aunt from Seattle
               is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade
               of the twentieth century, but were actually
               banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been
               one of the last citizens
               to mail one.<a href="#pcard" class="annotation">

               Since the French Revolution in the 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered effeminate.
               Though JJM is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can see
               how the dominant culture would have found dancing
               in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside
               women through ballroom dancing. We 
               do not know if he only attended these gatherings with his male friends or if women
               would join their group, but in the following 
               lines of JJM's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him
               about being a <q>"better boy"</q>. He seems to be 
               referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party

               States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, Emily Holt's 1901
               <cite>Encyclopaedia of Etiquette</cite> allows "brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly
               from the altar to a train or boat" to "wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade
               of blue" (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this 
               in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of "the chief adjuncts of this toilette" (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this 
               letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be
               preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she
               and her husband 
               immediately depart after the ceremony (Holt 238).<a href="#pWedding" class="annotation">

               A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves
               from job to job. 
               In <cite>The Engineers' Review</cite> volume 16 (1905), I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
               engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two
               jobs, even 
               though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
                  They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> (
               Lloyd 18). The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that 
               he is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909,
               
               he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer from the <em>Santa Clara</em> to the <em>Northwestern</em>. 
               Later in the current letter (04 October 1909), he details the number of the <em>Santa Clara</em>'s 
               engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications

               Tuxekan was renowned for its totem poles, and Klawock 
               created a Totem Park to display authentic and replica totem poles, which McIntyre
               seems to 
               anticipate here ("Visitor Information"). The preservation 
               effort doesn't seem to be isolated, as a 1927 <cite>New York Times</cite> 
               article laments the Alaskan Indians' <q>scant regard for the ritual of the old tradition</q> of 
               totem-making and relates the need for <q>funds for the preservation of these monuments</q> 
               ("Deserted Totems of Alaska").  [<a HREF="http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&amp;CISOPTR=9786&amp;REC=1" alt="Photograph of totems at old Tuxekan, Alaska's Digital Archives and Alaska State Library" target="blank">Totems at old Tuxekan</a>].

               <q>[T]he first cannery in Alaska was built [in Klawock] by a San Francisco firm in 1878.</q> 
               Until 1920, it remained the only salmon cannery in the state (
               "Visitor Information"). McIntyre may intend for his involvement with what at the time 
               was leading industrialization to impress Gladys, as he later takes a boastful tone
               when explaining 
               the specifications of the Northwestern in comparison to other ships.

               A promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship Company describes Ketchikan
               as 
               a tourist destination, and the waterfalls represent not only the leisure of sightseeing
               but
               also the rapid growth and modernization of Ketchikan's infrastructure. <q>The city has run 
                  pipes to the falls of the Ketchikan river which gives the citizens an opportunity
                  to procure 
                  water direct from this cold and refreshing stream. It is said to be the best system
                  in Alaska. 
                  Ketchikanites need have no fears of disease germs lurking in their drinking water.</q> McIntyre 
               and Palmer likely took what the guide calls <q>a jaunt of two miles along the Ketchikan River to 
                  the city's intake,</q> where <q>[a] walk has been built near the bank of this winding stream and the tourist 
                  wends his way among the timber until the first falls are reached</q> (<cite>A 
                  Trip to Wonderful Alaska</cite>).

               Here McIntyre seems to be referring to the boat on which he's currently sailing to
               catch up 
               with the Northwestern. The diminutive connotation fits with the boastful tone that
               he has 
               assumed to impress Gladys with the size and power of the Northwestern. Interestingly,
               the 
               term soap box hasn't yet entered common usage as a way of designating a smaller, unpowered 
               or low-power vehicle. It's possible that the "soap box" is a lightboat, which appears
               in the 
               closer to McIntyre's letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909.

               <cite>The Locomotive</cite> reports that on 11 March 
               1909, <q>[a] boiler exploded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the steamer Weitchpec</q> 
               and <q>Fireman Elmer Dennis was fatally scalded</q> ("March, 1909" 
               171). The serious and fatal nature of boiler accidents is clearly conveyed in 
               the volume's sizeable monthly catalogues. Additionally, a 1916 issue of <cite>The 
                  Popular Science Monthly</cite> laments that <q>[a]t present the life of coal-passers and engineers 
                  is one of extreme hazard.</q> To maintain pressure in the various compartments in the engine room, 
               <q>it is necessary for the men to enter or leave by means of air locks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This method
                  of entrance 
                  and exit is, therefore, very slow, and should the compartment become suddenly filled
                  
                  with steam or noxious gases, all the men at work could not gain the outer air in time
                  
                  to save their lives</q> ("Saving Men from 
               Scalding Steam in Steamship Engine Rooms" 254).

               The September 23 issue of <cite>The Seattle Star</cite> 
               reports that <q>a big Pope-Toledo automobile crashed through the bridge railing at Fourth av. S. 
                  and Lane st. shortly before 6 o'clock this morning.</q> It <q>crashed to 
                  the tideflats below</q> and <q>turned turtle, pinning its occupants beneath.</q> The auxiliary gas tank 
               caught fire upon the vehicle's crash. The driver, Henry Hiser, <q>managed to extricate himself</q> and 
               another passenger, but he <q>scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest</q> (
               "Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance"). 
               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Seattle Republican</cite> 
               further explains that Hiser <q>hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long</q> 
               and <q>drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to
                  the city at 
                  a speed of a mile a minute</q> ("Henry Hiser"). McIntyre 
               seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to
               Gladys of 13 August 
               1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance
               of the idea 
               of Gladys spending time with the drinking <q>Class.</q>

               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Leavenworth Echo</cite> 
               reports that <q>a Wallingford Avenue street car in Seattle jumped the track on a curve near the main
                  
                  gate of the [Alaska-Yukon Pacific] exposition. One man was killed, fifty five injured.
                  It was the 
                  first serious street car accident since the exposition opened</q> (
               "News of Pacific Northwest"). Drawing from contemporary articles in <cite>
                  The Seattle Times</cite> and <cite>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite>, Stein corroborates that 
               <q>[o]n September 24, 1909, a Seattle Electric Company streetcar jumps the track at the
                  
                  corner of E 40th Street and 14th Avenue NE (later University Way). The streetcar crashes
                  
                  into three concession buildings across the street from the main entrance of the 
                  Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. One passenger, Frank Hull of Tacoma, is killed, 
                  and 55 men, women, and children are injured</q> (Stein).
