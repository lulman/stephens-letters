            Writing from Seattle, Stephens describes the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and the
            city of Seattle, then reviews her correspondence with friends and family and lists
            the contents of a package she plans to send to her mother. </p>

            Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park, where she drove a
            coach of four horses for 3 days. She characterizes her travel companions as "the
            Virginians" and "some Germans." She describes the Forestry Building and its exhibits
            at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair and notes that the Seattle World's Fair buildings
            will later be used by Seattle College. She also remarks on Seattle, which she
            describes as looking "new" and having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings. </p>

            Stephens writes that she will probably not travel to Alaska because staterooms for
            the
            voyage are in such high demand. She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then
            describes her travel companion Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Hughes' famous cousins, Mrs.
            Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor, as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and
            now-deceased husband.</p>

            Stephens tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
            a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news
            of or gossip 
            about friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other
            individuals; 
            recounts being shown around by Uncle Alex; and mentions plans for a trip to Texas
            the following summer.

            The letter also describes McIntyre's life as a merchant marine, including his annual
            salary 
            and his recent transfer from the Santa Clara to the North Western.

            her aunt about the birth of her new baby.
            She mentions having received a letter from Gladys while the latter was traveling in
            Colorado.

            the difficulties of their long-distance
            relationship, and their attitudes toward courtship. He also mentions for the first
            time a two-year-old girl on the ship
            named Gladys, with whose family he strikes up an acquaintance.

            Writing during a late watch, McIntyre mentions the rough weather, mentions some pictures
            he plans to send Stephens, 
            describes a visit with "little Gladys" and her mother, complains about the difficulty
            of carrying on a
            correspondence abord ship, and muses at length about love.

            In another long letter, McIntyre describe his ship's cargo and its race with another
            ship along
            Alaska's Inside Passage. As he often does in this correspondence, he laments the difficulties
            of 
            a long-distance relationship conducted primarily through letters, and he muses about
            future trips
            that he and Stephens might take together.

            Writing from El Paso, Stephens evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
            and fiance, and recounts her own experience with head lice, which she 
            picked up in Mexico. Stephens also explains to her mother that she is 
            staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
            witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
            explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz,

            <br>Dear Mama,
            
            
            <p>
               I have made my 
               
               first trip to the Exposition 
               Grounds. They are simply
               dreams of beauty. Such 
               flowers—and such 
               quantities of them! There 
               is one place where there 
               are thousands and 
               thousands of white, 
               lavender and pure yellow 
               pansies. In one place 
               there are veritable terraces 
               of water with a falls between 
               This expanse is surrounded 
               by the most beautiful
               display of poppies I ever 
               
               
               saw. Then there are
               flowers like those I brought
               home from Senior Prom.—
               
               gerhaniums [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
               —<U>dwarf</U>
               sweet peas—every kind
               of flowers imaginable.
               Talk about roses, there
               are so many here that
               I can't think what
               California will be like.
               I went today with
               the Virginians. The men
               were hunting up old
               friends here in the
               city. I have a lot of
               truck, which I am going
               to send by mail. There
               are four pictures of
               Yellowstone which are
               exquisite—they are
               as natural as pictures
               can be. My Princetonian
               
               got them for me, and
               
               
               paid a dollar for
               them. The packages of tea
               I got at the Japanese
               tea garden from the
               little Japanese girl. I
               
               ordered (through Hayden)
               a 5 cent can of condensed
               milk.

               The buildings are  [fine?] 
               at the fair. One of the
               Virginian ladies said
               this fair is much superior
               
               to the St. Louis and others
               because of its compactness
               as well as its beauty.
               The buildings will be
               used later as college b'l'd'gs.
               Today we only visited
               
               those in the inner circle.

               There is a Hawaiian
               village with real bare
               natives. We are going to
               visit it later. There also  [<i>are</i>] 
               Esquimos and a village.
               I am sending you
               also the daily program.
               Have not found the

               raining and I slept until
               
               
               <U>3</U>
               8.25. We went to
               the Expo. at 10.30—got
               back at 4.40. Some day
               we are going up Puget
               Sound. I can do quite
               a stunt at eating now—
               devoured a small steak for
               my breakfast—a dish of
               strawberries, one of oatmeal,
               two muffins and three
               pancakes—and a cup of
               coffee. Sunburn is wearing
               off a trifle since I have
               left the park. They have a
               line of cable cars here, and
               some odd big ones. The
               population has increased
               150,000 in 2 years.
               
               I am getting to be
               quite a critic on buildings
               with two builders.

                done much on
               the writing stunt. I
               wrote Miss Childs a
               steamer letter, one to
               Gus, I think I wrote
               one to Roswel, and a
               dozen lines to Nat
               telling him that I
               was having a dandy
               time—never knew
               where I was going next
               and did not know
               when I'd be home;
               and hoped that he'd
               have as pleasant a
               summer as I was
               having. Found nothing
               at the P.O. Gee! but
               I'd like to hear. Will
               probably be here until
               
               the 20th perhaps
               the 24th. Am not sure

               rather rough last night, but
               it was just from the wind.

The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations. Pursers' duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the Purser Nautical Dictionary."><sup>9</sup></a>

A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition held in Seattle in 1909. Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition. Some of the postcards are in color and others are in black and white. It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909, so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens to mail one."><sup>10</sup></a>

               miles square. They have invited
               me to visit them, and Uncle

               have a business motive. I

               We had a great time last night— 
               our last on board. No one turned
               in before 12 some not until
               2. I did at 12. It seems awfully
               funny to be on land again.
               They certainly were glad to see

The Hotel Georgian was, in fact, a new hotel in Seattle when these visitors were staying there, built only one year before in 1908. It had seven floors and 108 rooms Shannon."><sup>12</sup></a>

               Well you never can tell what
               people will do. Walt certainly
               seems to be the limit. As for
               his mother  she is the
               limit.

         <p class="msDesc">This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead
            stationery
            measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The
            front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
            body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
            The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring
            approximately
            2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS
            |
            PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
            corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted
            that other letters
            in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from
            the same hotel, are 
            likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's
            excursion to Alaska,
            the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration
            rather than a photo, and depicts
            the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side
            of the building. 
            The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style
            than the slanted script)
            and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's
            names are printed
            ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under
            the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
            The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"),
            and so
            Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of
            center, inside the
            bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within
            the boundaries of the 
            letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style
            (some page numbers are followed
            by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>

            Georgian facade is printed on the left-hand side of the envelope above the hotel's

               few weeks that we have left 
               almost everyone else out.

                A 
               good big baby boy, not a little 
               teeny weeny; You know I 
               wished for a small baby, but 
               now that he is here I am glad 
               he is strong and perfect. If 
               I can only keep him well I 
               shall be happy. I am not very 
               strong yet but am gaining 
               
               every day a little, but I shall have to be 
               careful for awhile yet. Gladys is pleased 
               with her little brother and Willis is pleased 
               with his little son. I have only heard from 
               Gladys Stevens once. She was then in Colorado.
               I had hoped she would keep me posted as to 
               her travels. I suppose she will be home before 
               a great while now with many, many entertaining 
               things to tell you. I have thought of her very 
               often. Give my love to her when you see or write 
               her and tell her about my baby boy. You must 
               have missed her a very great deal. I hope you

We do not know if he attended these gatherings with only his male friends or if women would join their group, but in the following lines of McIntyre's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him about being a better boy.

               called <cite>the Holy City</cite> and It promises
               to be good. A few lines which I gave

            <p><q>what is Love</q></p>

            <p>I had a great romp with little

               her to my window (I have a room
               same as the chiefs on Santa Clara only
               the door opens in engine room instead
               of deck) and she hollered for uncle that's
               what she calls me and I took her
               in side gave her an Orange dow [<i>n</i>] 
               to the engine room and she was not
               a bit afraid and It was a pleasure

                have only a wee Gladys
               
               to talk to and I said lots
               of things to her about —O well—
               well she laughed and seemed to
               enjoy it any way although
               could not understand

            <p>I almost believe honey that I

               the opportunity could be and your
               permission <U>do you</U>
               I often wonder If you give
               me  little thought when alone
               at night after a day of pleasure
               of pleasure (—I hope) remember

               for I want to tell my mother
               all about you on my return
               but nothing to do but wait and
               wish for the best is they dear

               What is
               the trouble, are you
               sick? I looked and
               looked for a letter
               today, but none
               came. I declare
               if I don't get
               one tomorrow I
               
               will send a
               telegram to
               to Berenice Smith. 
               It is pretty warm
               here now, yet
               there was a big
               rain last night.

               My Alaska
               ring came here
               
               the 23 of Aug. I
               got it this
               morning. It is
               a beauty.
               </p>
            
            <p>
               Oh about the
               pillow. Mrs. L.  was 
               much pleased
               with it and thought
               it handsome and
               it is in the
               parlour.

               Adelaide is getting some lovely
               things to be married in. She is having
               a pale blue broadcloth dress made. She
               has a handsome brown suit.<a id="pWedding" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nWedding" class="annotation" title="Though white wedding dresses were traditionally preferred in the United States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, Emily Holt's 1901 Encyclopaedia of Etiquette allows &#34;brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly from the altar to a train or boat&#34; to &#34;wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue&#34; (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of &#34;the chief adjuncts of this toilette&#34; (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after the ceremony Holt 238."><sup>21</sup></a>

               I have found out some startling
               
               information today. I went to the
               hairdressers to have a shampoo.
               On account of the amt. of alkali
               in the water people can not [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]

               &amp; I made arrangements to go together
               this morning. What do you suppose
               the woman found--<U>bugs</U> in
               my head! I got them in Mexico.
               They all told me I'd be apt
               to get them. I thought I'd escaped
               however. Now what <U>do</U> you think
               of that. Well she worked good
               and hard and dosed my head and
               I have to go again Sat. morning.
               Their deposit was not large and
               so we have hopes of soon cleaning
               it all out. You can imagine
               how I feel. There isn't on the
               average one American in ten
               who goes there without getting
               loaded. Here's hoping I'll be clear
               of it all soon.

         <p class="msDesc"> ALS. Two loose sheets of cream-colored Office of the Treasurer, Santa Cruz County,
            California
            letterhead stationary measuring 8.56 x 11 inches. The front of each sheet of letterhead
            contains
            a 2.125 x 2 inch black and white image of a building in the upper left corner of the
            page and 
            an image of flowers with a scroll bearing the words "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CALIFORNIA,"
            along with
            a medallion emblazoned with the words "Office of Treasurer." The combined image of
            the scroll, 
            flowers, and medallion measures 2.125 x 4.25 inches. Underneath the image is text
            that reads 
            "W.H. BIAS Treasurer" and "R.W. BIAS Deputy Treas.," followed by a line for the date
            partially
            pre-printed as "________ / 1___." The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, though there
            is some
            reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive.
            The paper has 
            light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides
            and that are 
            0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting
            3.063 inches
            from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet.
            On the 
            back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue
            until 0.1875 inches
            from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets
            were placed 
            together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin,
            but not overly
            fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND."
            When viewing 
            the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.</p>
         <div class="envelope">
             Accompanied
            by a stamped, canceled, dark cream-colored envelope made from heavy paper and measuring
            5.875 x 3.5 inches.There is a printed black and white image measuring 2.75 x 1.875
            inches 
            of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG
            RAFT 
            COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark
            is
            from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens, 
            26 Emerson Street, Newton, Massachusets." There is an additional endorsement on the
            envelope in a different
            hand than the written address of a circled 10, then a 9/25. The 25 is also circled.
            The envelope
            is cleanly slit along the right edge.

            "Alaska Steamship Company," below which and right-justified is a solid black line
            
            interrupted by "190" for the date of composition. Measuring approximately 1 inch 
            by 1 inch at the top left corner of the recto is the Alaska Steamship Company 
            logo, reading "Alaska | Steamship Co. | Black Ball | Line" over a black sphere in

               form at the top for the dateline, we encode the printed text around her handwriting
               with a &lt;supplied&gt; element, but other printed parts of the letterhead are not
               encoded. They are described briefly in the manuscript descriptions following the letters

               Observation Wagon" used to take visitors on a
               "Grand Loop" of Yellowstone Park. Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park
               Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern
               Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth
               Hot
               Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume <cite>The Yellowstone Park</cite>,
               Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes <q>tourist
                  transportation</q> through the park as <q>mostly by coach, ordinarily with four
                  horses each</q> (203). He comments that these coaches were a <q>necessity</q>
               because <q>The points of interest are so scattered</q> (Chittenden 274).

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nForestryBld"></a>4.&nbsp;The Forestry Building served as a botanical and
               natural museum after the World's Fair concluded. It was torn down in 1930, at which
               point the log columns that Gladys describes had been damaged beyond repair by insects.
               The University of Washington Library's Special Collections Web site notes that the
               Forestry Building was <q>sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to
                  showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton
                  created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which
                  also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous
                  unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry
                  Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior spaces evoked the majesty of
                  Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally, implied the great
                  potential wealth they contained</q>

               British politician Waldorf Astor and later succeeded him as a Member of Parliament;
               she was the first woman to sit in the British House of Commons. Nancy and Irene are

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nPurser"></a>9.&nbsp;The Purser on a cruise ship traditionally has several
               important responsibilities. They provide customer service to guests; they also handle
               money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests—which may have involved
               buying luxury goods on credit and bringing them aboard. The Purser also helps guests
               with paperwork such as customs declarations. Pursers' duties are similar in definition
               to
               the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of
               record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes
               sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the

            <p class="hang25"><a id="ncard"></a>10.&nbsp;The "A.Y.P. cards" Gladys
               mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.
               A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which
               are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature
               various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition
               held in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer
               for the event, amateur photographers
               were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and
               so several different individuals
               and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are
               in color and others 
               are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to
               her aunt from Seattle
               is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade
               of the twentieth century, but were actually
               banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909, so Gladys may have been
               one of the last citizens
               to mail one.<a href="#pcard" class="annotation">

               the best of several different calculations to measure an individual's net worth,
               suggesting that Gladys is in the company of some astoundingly wealthy people at the

               here that "They certainly were glad to see us here at the hotel," Gladys—and
               apparently the other passengers on the excursion to Alaska—stayed at the Hotel
               Georgian before and after the voyage north, and it is a familiar place to the group.
               The Hotel Georgian was, in fact, a new hotel in Seattle when these visitors were
               staying there, built only one year before in 1908. It had seven floors and 108
               rooms (Shannon).<a href="#photel" class="annotation">

               Since the French Revolution in the late 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered
               effeminate.
               Though McIntyre is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can
               see how the dominant culture would have found dancing
               in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside
               women through ballroom dancing. We 
               do not know if he  attended these gatherings with only his male friends or if women
               would join their group, but in the following 
               lines of McIntyre's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with
               him about being a <q>better boy</q>. He seems to be 
               referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party
               or dance

            <p class="hang25"><a id="nWedding"></a>21.&nbsp;Though white wedding dresses were traditionally
               preferred in the United States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in
               1840, Emily Holt's 1901 <cite>Encyclopaedia of Etiquette</cite> allows
               "brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly from the
               altar to a train or boat" to "wear a becoming street dress of ladies'
               cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue" (Holt 238). Holt adds that
               if the bride wears this in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is
               one
               of "the chief adjuncts of this toilette" (238). Based on Gladys's
               description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her
               mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either
               takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after
               the ceremony (Holt 238).<a href="#pWedding" class="annotation">

               made from bitters and brandy, gin, or whiskey. Stephens's disapproving attitude of
               alcohol may reflect the growing temperance movement that was very strong in Boston,
               near where Stephens lived (Thomas
               49-52).<a href="#pCocktail" class="annotation">

               feathers was signficantly ramped up in the United States, particularly the American
               South, West and Southwest, as a means of freeing American consumers from the import
               market dominated by South African production. Considered fashionable, the feathers

               A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves
               from job to job. 
               In <cite>The Engineers' Review</cite>, I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
               engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two
               jobs, even 
               though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
                  They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> (
               Lloyd 18). The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that 
               <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span> is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909,
               
               he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer him from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Santa Clara</span> to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northwestern</span>. 
               Later in the current letter, he details the number of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Santa Clara</span>'s 
               engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications
               and boiler operation.

               Tuxekan was renowned for its totem poles, and Klawock 
               created a Totem Park to display authentic and replica totem poles, which McIntyre
               seems to 
               anticipate here ("Visitor Information"). The preservation 
               effort doesn't seem to be isolated, as a 1927 <cite>New York Times</cite> 
               article laments the Alaskan Indians' <q>scant regard for the ritual of the old tradition</q> of 
               totem-making and relates the need for <q>funds for the preservation of these monuments</q> 
               ("Deserted Totems of Alaska").  [<a HREF="http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&amp;CISOPTR=9786&amp;REC=1" target="blank">Totems at old Tuxekan</a>].

               <q>[T]he first cannery in Alaska was built [in Klawock] by a San Francisco firm in 1878,</q> 
               and until 1920, it remained the only salmon cannery in the state (
               "Visitor Information"). McIntyre may intend for his involvement with what at the time 
               was leading industrialization to impress Gladys, as he later takes a boastful tone
               when explaining 
               the specifications of the Northwestern in comparison to other ships.  [<a HREF="http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&amp;CISOPTR=13554&amp;REC=7" target="blank">The Cannery at Klawock</a>].

               A promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship Company describes Ketchikan
               as 
               a tourist destination, and the waterfalls represent not only the leisure of sightseeing
               but
               also the rapid growth and modernization of Ketchikan's infrastructure. <q>The city has run 
                  pipes to the falls of the Ketchikan river which gives the citizens an opportunity
                  to procure 
                  water direct from this cold and refreshing stream. It is said to be the best system
                  in Alaska. 
                  Ketchikanites need have no fears of disease germs lurking in their drinking water.</q> McIntyre 
               and Palmer likely took what the guide calls <q>a jaunt of two miles along the Ketchikan River to 
                  the city's intake,</q> where <q>[a] walk has been built near the bank of this winding stream and the tourist 
                  wends his way among the timber until the first falls are reached</q> (<cite>A 
                  Trip to Wonderful Alaska</cite>).  [<a HREF="https://images.asc.ohio-state.edu/is/image/englishdocs/E/e4acdd32-7352-4615-9fdc-8e26439d1268.jpg/?size=600,600&amp;fmt=png" target="blank">Ketchikan in Wonderful Alaska</a>].

               Here McIntyre seems to be referring to the boat on which he's currently sailing to
               catch up 
               with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northwestern</span>. The diminutive connotation fits with the boastful tone that he has 
               assumed to impress Gladys with the size and power of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northwestern</span>. Interestingly, the 
               term <span style="font-style:italic;">soap box</span> hasn't yet entered common usage as a way of designating a smaller, unpowered 
               or low-power vehicle. It's possible that the "soap box" is a lightboat, which appears
               in the 
               closer to McIntyre's letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909.

               <cite>The Locomotive</cite> reports that on 11 March

               and <q>Fireman Elmer Dennis was fatally scalded</q> ("March, 1909" 
               171). The serious and fatal nature of boiler accidents is clearly conveyed in 
               the volume's sizeable monthly catalogues. Additionally, a 1916 issue of <cite>The 
                  Popular Science Monthly</cite> laments that <q>[a]t present the life of coal-passers and engineers 
                  is one of extreme hazard.</q> To maintain pressure in the various compartments in the engine room, 
               <q>it is necessary for the men to enter or leave by means of air locks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This method
                  of entrance 
                  and exit is, therefore, very slow, and should the compartment become suddenly filled
                  
                  with steam or noxious gases, all the men at work could not gain the outer air in time
                  
                  to save their lives</q> ("Saving Men from 
               Scalding Steam in Steamship Engine Rooms" 254).

               The September 23 issue of <cite>The Seattle Star</cite> 
               reports that <q>a big Pope-Toledo automobile crashed through the bridge railing at Fourth av. S. 
                  and Lane st. shortly before 6 o'clock this morning.</q> It <q>crashed to 
                  the tideflats below</q> and <q>turned turtle, pinning its occupants beneath.</q> The auxiliary gas tank 
               caught fire upon the vehicle's crash. The driver, Henry Hiser, <q>managed to extricate himself</q> and 
               another passenger, but he <q>scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest</q> (
               "Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance"). 
               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Seattle Republican</cite> 
               further explains that Hiser <q>hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long</q> 
               and <q>drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to
                  the city at 
                  a speed of a mile a minute</q> ("Henry Hiser"). McIntyre 
               seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to
               Gladys of 13 August 
               1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance
               of the idea 
               of Gladys spending time with the drinking <q>Class.</q>

               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Leavenworth Echo</cite> 
               reports that <q>a Wallingford Avenue street car in Seattle jumped the track on a curve near the main
                  
                  gate of the [Alaska-Yukon Pacific] exposition. One man was killed, fifty five injured.
                  It was the 
                  first serious street car accident since the exposition opened</q> (
               "News of Pacific Northwest"). Drawing from contemporary articles in <cite>
                  The Seattle Times</cite> and <cite>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite>, Stein corroborates that 
               <q>[o]n September 24, 1909, a Seattle Electric Company streetcar jumps the track at the
                  
                  corner of E 40th Street and 14th Avenue NE (later University Way). The streetcar crashes
                  
                  into three concession buildings across the street from the main entrance of the 
                  Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. One passenger, Frank Hull of Tacoma, is killed, 
                  and 55 men, women, and children are injured</q> (Alan Stein).
