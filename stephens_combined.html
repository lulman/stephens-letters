            Writing from Seattle, Stephens describes the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and the
            city of Seattle, then reviews her correspondence with friends and family and lists
            the contents of a package she plans to send to her mother. </p>

            Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park, where she drove a
            coach of four horses for 3 days. She characterizes her travel companions as "the
            Virginians" and "some Germans." She describes the Forestry Building and its exhibits
            at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair and notes that the Seattle World's Fair buildings
            will later be used by Seattle College. She also remarks on Seattle, which she
            describes as looking "new" and having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings. </p>

            Stephens writes that she will probably not travel to Alaska because staterooms for
            the
            voyage are in such high demand. She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then
            describes her travel companion Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Hughes' famous cousins, Mrs.
            Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor, as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and
            now-deceased husband.</p>

            Stephens tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
            a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news
            of or gossip 
            about friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other
            individuals; 
            recounts being shown around by Uncle Alex; and mentions plans for a trip to Texas
            the following summer.

            The letter also describes McIntyre's life as a merchant marine, including his annual
            salary 
            and his recent transfer from the Santa Clara to the North Western.

            her aunt about the birth of her new baby.
            She mentions having received a letter from Gladys while the latter was traveling in
            Colorado.

            the difficulties of their long-distance
            relationship, and their attitudes toward courtship. He also mentions for the first
            time a two-year-old girl on the ship

            Writing during a late watch, McIntyre mentions the rough weather, mentions some pictures
            he plans to send Stephens, 
            describes a visit with "little Gladys" and her mother, complains about the difficulty
            of carrying on a

            In another long letter, McIntyre describe his ship's cargo and its race with another
            ship along
            Alaska's Inside Passage. As he often does in this correspondence, he laments the difficulties
            of 
            a long-distance relationship conducted primarily through letters, and he muses about
            future trips
            that he and Stephens might take together.

            Writing from El Paso, Stephens evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
            and fiance, and recounts her own experience with head lice, which she 
            picked up in Mexico. Stephens also explains to her mother that she is 
            staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
            witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
            explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz, 
            Vice-President Reyes, and the general populace.

The University of Washington Library's Special Collections Web site notes that the Forestry Building was sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings.

They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests—which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit and bringing them aboard. The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations. Pursers' duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the Purser Nautical Dictionary."><sup>9</sup></a>

A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition held in Seattle in 1909. Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition. Some of the postcards are in color and others are in black and white. It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909, so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens to mail one."><sup>10</sup></a>

         <p class="msDesc">This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead
            stationery
            measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The
            front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
            body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
            The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring
            approximately
            2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS
            |
            PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
            corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted
            that other letters
            in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from
            the same hotel, are 
            likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's
            excursion to Alaska,
            the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration
            rather than a photo, and depicts
            the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side
            of the building. 
            The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style
            than the slanted script)
            and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's
            names are printed
            ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under
            the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
            The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"),
            and so
            Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of
            center, inside the
            bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within
            the boundaries of the 
            letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style
            (some page numbers are followed
            by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>

When men participated, it was alongside women through ballroom dancing. We do not know if he attended these gatherings with only his male friends or if women would join their group, but in the following lines of McIntyre's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him about being a better boy.

             Gladys tonight her mother fetched
            <br>0095&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            her to my window (I have a room

            what she calls me and I took her

            a bit afraid and It was a pleasure

            Adelaide is getting some lovely
            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            things to be married in. She is having
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            a pale blue broadcloth dress made. She
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has a handsome brown suit.<a id="pWedding" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nWedding" class="annotation" title="Though white wedding dresses were traditionally preferred in the United States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840, Emily Holt's 1901 Encyclopaedia of Etiquette allows &#34;brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly from the altar to a train or boat&#34; to &#34;wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue&#34; (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of &#34;the chief adjuncts of this toilette&#34; (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after the ceremony Holt 238."><sup>21</sup></a>

            this morning. What do you suppose

            the woman found--<U>bugs</U> in

            my head! I got them in Mexico.
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            They all told me I'd be apt
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to get them. I thought I'd escaped
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            of that. Well she worked good

            Their deposit was not large and
            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so we have hopes of soon cleaning
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            it all out. You can imagine
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            how I feel. There isn't on the

            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            loaded. Here's hoping I'll be clear

            California
            letterhead stationary measuring 8.56 x 11 inches. The front of each sheet of letterhead
            contains
            a 2.125 x 2 inch black and white image of a building in the upper left corner of the
            page and 
            an image of flowers with a scroll bearing the words "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CALIFORNIA,"
            along with
            a medallion emblazoned with the words "Office of Treasurer." The combined image of
            the scroll, 
            flowers, and medallion measures 2.125 x 4.25 inches. Underneath the image is text
            that reads 
            "W.H. BIAS Treasurer" and "R.W. BIAS Deputy Treas.," followed by a line for the date
            partially
            pre-printed as "________ / 1___." The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, though there
            is some
            reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive.
            The paper has 
            light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides
            and that are 
            0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting
            3.063 inches
            from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet.
            On the 
            back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue
            until 0.1875 inches
            from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets
            were placed 
            together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin,
            but not overly
            fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND."
            When viewing 
            the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.</p>

            inches 
            of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG
            RAFT 
            COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark
            is
            from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens,

The driver, Henry Hiser, managed to extricate himself and another passenger, but he scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance. The October 1 issue of The Seattle Republican further explains that Hiser hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long and drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to the city at a speed of a mile a minute Henry Hiser. McIntyre seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance of the idea of Gladys spending time with the drinking Class."><sup>41</sup></a>

               encoded. They are described briefly in the manuscript descriptions following the letters

               Observation Wagon" used to take visitors on a
               "Grand Loop" of Yellowstone Park. Starting in 1884, the Yellowstone Park
               Transportation Company operated on a stage coach line that began at the Northern
               Pacific Railroad terminal in Cinnabar, Montana, connected to the hotel at Mammoth
               Hot
               Springs, and continued throughout the park. In his 1895 volume <cite>The Yellowstone Park</cite>,
               Hiram Martin Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers describes <q>tourist
                  transportation</q> through the park as <q>mostly by coach, ordinarily with four
                  horses each</q> (203). He comments that these coaches were a <q>necessity</q>
               because <q>The points of interest are so scattered</q> (Chittenden 274).

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nForestryBld"></a>4.&nbsp;The Forestry Building served as a botanical and
               natural museum after the World's Fair concluded. It was torn down in 1930, at which
               point the log columns that Gladys describes had been damaged beyond repair by insects.
               The University of Washington Library's Special Collections Web site notes that the
               Forestry Building was <q>sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to
                  showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton
                  created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which
                  also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous
                  unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry
                  Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior spaces evoked the majesty of
                  Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally, implied the great
                  potential wealth they contained</q>

               she was the first woman to sit in the British House of Commons. Nancy and Irene are

               important responsibilities. They provide customer service to guests; they also handle
               money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests—which may have involved
               buying luxury goods on credit and bringing them aboard. The Purser also helps guests
               with paperwork such as customs declarations. Pursers' duties are similar in definition
               to
               the ship's steward. So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners of
               record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes
               sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir from the

               mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.
               A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which

               held in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer
               for the event, amateur photographers
               were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and
               so several different individuals
               and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are
               in color and others 
               are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to
               her aunt from Seattle
               is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade
               of the twentieth century, but were actually
               banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909, so Gladys may have been
               one of the last citizens
               to mail one.<a href="#pcard" class="annotation">

               here that "They certainly were glad to see us here at the hotel," Gladys—and

               The Hotel Georgian was, in fact, a new hotel in Seattle when these visitors were

               Since the French Revolution in the late 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered
               effeminate.
               Though McIntyre is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can
               see how the dominant culture would have found dancing
               in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside
               women through ballroom dancing. We 
               do not know if he  attended these gatherings with only his male friends or if women
               would join their group, but in the following 
               lines of McIntyre's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with
               him about being a <q>better boy</q>. He seems to be 
               referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party

               preferred in the United States and Great Britain since Queen Victoria's wedding in
               1840, Emily Holt's 1901 <cite>Encyclopaedia of Etiquette</cite> allows
               "brides who are married before twelve o'clock, or who go directly from the
               altar to a train or boat" to "wear a becoming street dress of ladies'
               cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue" (Holt 238). Holt adds that
               if the bride wears this in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is
               one
               of "the chief adjuncts of this toilette" (238). Based on Gladys's
               description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this letter and in her letter to her
               mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either
               takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband immediately depart after
               the ceremony (Holt 238).<a href="#pWedding" class="annotation">

               made from bitters and brandy, gin, or whiskey. Stephens's disapproving attitude of
               alcohol may reflect the growing temperance movement that was very strong in Boston,

               A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves
               from job to job. 
               In <cite>The Engineers' Review</cite>, I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
               engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two
               jobs, even 
               though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
                  They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> (
               Lloyd 18). The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that 
               <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span> is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909,
               
               he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer him from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Santa Clara</span> to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northwestern</span>. 
               Later in the current letter, he details the number of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Santa Clara</span>'s 
               engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications
               and boiler operation.

               effort doesn't seem to be isolated, as a 1927 <cite>New York Times</cite> 
               article laments the Alaskan Indians' <q>scant regard for the ritual of the old tradition</q> of

               171). The serious and fatal nature of boiler accidents is clearly conveyed in 
               the volume's sizeable monthly catalogues. Additionally, a 1916 issue of <cite>The 
                  Popular Science Monthly</cite> laments that <q>[a]t present the life of coal-passers and engineers 
                  is one of extreme hazard.</q> To maintain pressure in the various compartments in the engine room, 
               <q>it is necessary for the men to enter or leave by means of air locks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This method
                  of entrance 
                  and exit is, therefore, very slow, and should the compartment become suddenly filled
                  
                  with steam or noxious gases, all the men at work could not gain the outer air in time
                  
                  to save their lives</q> ("Saving Men from 
               Scalding Steam in Steamship Engine Rooms" 254).

               The September 23 issue of <cite>The Seattle Star</cite> 
               reports that <q>a big Pope-Toledo automobile crashed through the bridge railing at Fourth av. S. 
                  and Lane st. shortly before 6 o'clock this morning.</q> It <q>crashed to 
                  the tideflats below</q> and <q>turned turtle, pinning its occupants beneath.</q> The auxiliary gas tank 
               caught fire upon the vehicle's crash. The driver, Henry Hiser, <q>managed to extricate himself</q> and 
               another passenger, but he <q>scurried from the scene and was later placed under arrest</q> (
               "Two Girls Burned and Crushed Beyond Human Resemblance"). 
               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Seattle Republican</cite> 
               further explains that Hiser <q>hauled a seventeen-year-old girl from saloon to saloon all night long</q> 
               and <q>drank until he was almost beastly drunk and then started over a dangerous road to
                  the city at 
                  a speed of a mile a minute</q> ("Henry Hiser"). McIntyre 
               seems to admit here that he used to practice a similar lifestyle. In his letter to
               Gladys of 13 August 
               1909, he expresses his committment to abstaining from drinking and the repugnance
               of the idea 
               of Gladys spending time with the drinking <q>Class.</q>

               The October 1 issue of <cite>The Leavenworth Echo</cite> 
               reports that <q>a Wallingford Avenue street car in Seattle jumped the track on a curve near the main
                  
                  gate of the [Alaska-Yukon Pacific] exposition. One man was killed, fifty five injured.
                  It was the 
                  first serious street car accident since the exposition opened</q> (
               "News of Pacific Northwest"). Drawing from contemporary articles in <cite>
                  The Seattle Times</cite> and <cite>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite>, Stein corroborates that 
               <q>[o]n September 24, 1909, a Seattle Electric Company streetcar jumps the track at the
                  
                  corner of E 40th Street and 14th Avenue NE (later University Way). The streetcar crashes
                  
                  into three concession buildings across the street from the main entrance of the 
                  Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. One passenger, Frank Hull of Tacoma, is killed, 
                  and 55 men, women, and children are injured</q> (Alan Stein).

            About this View of the Letters
            </h2>
         <p><a id="view"></a>This presentation of the Stephens letters derives from the
            project's main XML file, StephensCorpus.xml, transformed with Stephens-Common.xsl
            and
            Stephens-CombinedView.xsl. Facsimiles of pages appear next to the edited text. In
            the text
            of the letter, line and page breaks follow those in the manuscript; paragraph breaks
            are not
            reported. Spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as
            they appear
            in the manuscript. Text highlighted by Hawthorne with an underscore is underscored.
            Text
            canceled by Hawthorne is presented in a red, strikethrough font. Uncertain readings
            are
            enclosed in square brackets and followed by a question mark. Text added by Hawthorne
            between
            lines is preceded by an arrow indicating whether the addition is above or below the
            line and
            followed by an arrow indicating the return to the line (↑ ↓); text added in the
            margins is preceded and followed by a vertical bar (|). Text added by Hawthorne in
            the
            margins is surrounded by "pipe" characters (|) at the point in the main text that
            it appears
            to follow. Links to external materials are colored and underlined.
