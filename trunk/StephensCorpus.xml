            <lb/>I have made my 
            <!-- Is "Exposition Grounds" a place, a referring string, or an event? -->
            <lb/>first trip to the <placeName>Exposition 
            <lb/>Grounds</placeName>. They are simply
            <lb/>dreams of beauty. Such 
            <lb/>flowers—and such 
            <lb/>quantities of them! There 
            <lb/>is one place where there 
            <lb/>are thousands <seg type="obliqueText" rendition="#ot1">and</seg> 
            <lb/>thousands of white, 
            <lb/>lavender <seg type="obliqueText" rendition="#ot1">and</seg> pure yellow 
            <lb/>pansies. In one place 
            <lb/>there are veritable terraces 
            <lb/>of water with a falls between 
            <lb/>This expanse is surrounded 
            <lb/>by the most beautiful

            <lb/>saw. Then there are
            <lb/>flowers like those I brought
            <lb/>home from Senior Prom.—
            <!-- Is that really an "h" in the middle of "geraniums"? -->
            <lb/>gerhaniums—<hi rend="underlined">dwarf</hi>
            <lb/>sweet peas—every kind
            <lb/>of flowers imaginable.
            <lb/>Talk abut roses, there
            <lb/>are so many here that
            <lb/>I can't think what
            <lb/>California will be like.
            <lb/>I went today with
            <lb/>the <rs>Virginians</rs>. The men
            <lb/>were hunting up old
            <lb/>friends here in the
            <lb/>city. I have a lot of
            <lb/>truck, which I am going
            <lb/>to send by mail. There
            <lb/>are four pictures of
            <lb/><placeName>Yellowstone</placeName> which are
            <lb/>exquisite—they are
            <lb/>as natural as pictures
            <lb/>can be. My <rs>Princetonian</rs>
            <!-- Is "and" written at an angle a form of highlighting? -->
            <lb/>got them for me, and
            <pb facs="/0/080321f8-ac6c-4871-8a4c-ab55b041faa8"/>
            <!-- What do I do about the repeated letterhead? -->
            <lb/>paid a dollar for
            <lb/>them. The packages of tea
            <lb/>I got at the Japanese
            <lb/>tea garden from the
            <lb/><rs>little Japanese girl</rs>. I
            <!-- Is "Hayden" a person or a company? -->
            <lb/>ordered (through Hayden)
            <lb/>a 5 cent can of condense
            <lb/>milk.

          <p>
            <lb/>The buildings are <unclear>fine</unclear>
            <lb/>at the fair. One of the
            <lb/>Virginian ladies said
            <lb/>this fair is much superior
            <!-- A rs for an event? Or an abbreviation? -->
            <lb/>to <rs>the St. Louis</rs> and others
            <lb/>because of its compactness
            <lb/>as well as its beauty.
            <lb/>The buildings will be
            <lb/>used later as college <choice><abbr >b'l'd'gs</abbr><expan>buildings</expan></choice>.

            <lb/>There is a Hawaiian

            <lb/>Esquimos and a village.

            <lb/>the Expo. at 10.30—got
            <lb/>back at 4.40. Some day
            <lb/>we are going up <geogName>Puget

            <lb/>a stunt at eating now—
            <lb/>devoured a small steak for
            <lb/>my breakfast—a dish of
            <lb/>strawberries, one of oatmeal,
            <lb/>two muffins and three
            <lb/>pancakes—and a cup of
            <lb/>coffee. Sunburn is wearing
            <lb/>off a trifle since I have
            <lb/>left <rs>the park</rs>. They have a
            <lb/>line of cable cars here, and
            <lb/>some odd big ones. The

            <lb/>150,000 in 2 years.

            <lb/>I am getting to be

            <lb/>Havent done much on
            <lb/>the writing stunt. I
            <lb/>wrote Miss Childs a

            <lb/>Gus, I think I wrote
            <lb/>one to Roswel, and a
            <lb/>dozen lines to Nat
            <lb/>telling him that I
            <lb/>was having a dandy
            <lb/>time—never knew
            <lb/>where I was going next
            <lb/>and did not know
            <lb/>when I'd be home;
            <lb/>and hoped that he'd
            <lb/>have as pleasant a
            <lb/>summer as I was
            <lb/>having. Found nothing
            <lb/>at the P.O. Gee! but
            <lb/>I'd like to hear. Will
            <lb/>probably be here until
