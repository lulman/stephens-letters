            And this
            leads to another law—never to keep a letter, if possible. If it be interesting
            beyond the usual, it probably has in it some things which had better be forgotten.
            If it is commonplace, it is not worth the keeping. Old love-letters are often
            profaned by careless eyes; old gossip is raked up. Of course there are
            exceptions—charming letters with no sting in them. But they are exceptions. If all
            letters were burned as soon as answered, there would be that much less trouble in
            the world—as any lawyer can testify.<br><br>— Priscilla Leonard, "The Laws of Letter
            Writing" (<cite>Harper’s Bazaar</cite>, November 1904)
            
            <br></p>
         
         <p> As any historian,
            rhetorician, or casual reader of personal letters—whether those of ancestors or
            historical figures—can testify, if people followed Priscilla Leonard’s advice in
            "The Laws of Letter Writing" to burn letters as soon as they are answered, our
            personal and cultural histories would be poorer to the degree that the threads of
            any one individual’s experiences, perceptions, and practices contribute to the
            entire fabric of the past. More specifically, had Gladys M. Stephens (b. 1892?)
            followed Leonard’s advice, we would lack the rich tapestry of information about
            travel, tourism, commerce, courtship, and personal correspondence in the first
            decades of the twentieth century contained in the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of
            Stephens Family Letters and Ephemera housed in the Rare Books and Manuscripts
            collection at The Ohio State University Libraries (the dated items in the collection
            were written between 1834 and 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date from the
            decade before the U.S. entry into World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p> Stephens emerges as the
            central figure in the 899 separate items in the collection. She is the recipient of
            334 of the 449 letters in the collection and 138 of the postcards, as well as the
            author of 54 letters and postcards. Presumably, we can thank her for violating
            Leonard’s law. We know little of Stephens's life beyond the experiences recorded in
            the letters. She was born in Newton, MA, attended Boston University in 1907 and 1909
            as a "special student" (<cite>Year Book</cite>), and is listed in the 1920 U.S. Census as single
            and living at her parents' home in Newton. In the summer of 1909, at the age of 17,
            she set out on a cross-country trip that took her from Newton to Seattle—with a stop
            at Yellowstone National Park—to visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and travel
            via steamer up the Inside Passage of southeast Alaska. At some point along the way,
            she met James J. McIntyre, a "tramp engineer" employed by the Alaska Steamship
            Company, and, judging by his letters to her, formed a romantic relationship with
            him. From Seattle, Stephens travelled via California to El Paso, TX to visit an
            uncle, arriving in the midst of revolutionary unrest in neighboring Mexico.
            
         </p>
         
         <p> This edition of selected
            letters from the collection presents fifteen letters written during the summer and
            fall of 1909, eight written by Stephens to her parents about her travels, six by
            McIntyre to Stephens in which he describes his work on various merchant ships and
            professes his love for Stephens, and one by Stephens’s cousin Cora Anderson to
            Stephens’s mother in which she inquires about Stephens. Together, these letters
            represent at three of the four genres of letter writing for which Priscilla Leonard
            offer laws: the personal letter, the social letter, and the love-letter—depending,
            of course, on how one limns the boundaries of the genres. As is the case with any
            personal correspondence, these letters invite at least two vectors of
            interpretation: how the writers understand and employ the genre and material
            practices of letter-writing, and how the writers’ words constitute a window looking
            onto the wider world. Students of epistolary rhetoric will find much of interest in
            the Stephens letters. For example, in "The Laws of Letter Writing" Leonard cautions,
            <br><div class="blockquote">[W]hen we
               must commit our fortunes to a written page, to be read, perhaps at an unpropitious
               moment, hundreds of miles away, it behooves us to know how to make that written
               page say what we would, and make the exact impression we desire. (1125)
               <br></div>
            
         </p>
         
         <p> As if he had read and
            absorbed this caution, James McIntyre seems acutely aware of the dangers of making
            the wrong impression in his letter to Gladys Stephens of 21 August 1909: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">[H]ow I
               wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being of quite a different
               desposition [sic] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of mind and you not so
               much so.
               <br></div>
            
         </p>
         
         <p> And in a letter to her
            mother written on 6 July 1909 from Seattle, Stephens reflects, as she often does in
            her letters, on her own and others’ attention to the social obligations of letter
            writing: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">Havent
               [sic] done much on the writing stunt. I wrote Miss Childs a steamer letter, one to
               Gus, I think I wrote one to Roswel, and a dozen lines to Nat telling him that I
               was having a dandy time—never knew where I was going next and did not know when
               I'd be home; and hoped that he'd have as pleasant a summer as I was having. Found
               nothing at the P.O. Gee! but I'd like to hear.
               <br></div>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p> Students of early
            twentieth-century history will also find much of interest in the letters, from
            McIntyre’s accounts of life on merchant vessels plying Alaska’s Inside Passage to
            Stephens’s accounts of traveling through Yellowstone National Park by stagecoach,
            visiting the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle, and observing political
            unrest in Mexico:              
            <br><div class="blockquote">Uncle
               says I must stay to see the Presidents meet and then I can go home immediately
               after that. He says Dias is so old (79) that I probably will never get another
               chance to see anything of the kind again. A revolution in Mexico is imminent if
               Dias dies. The Vice Pres. Reyes wants to be Pres. and the people hate him
               terribly. They have to have Rurales every where [sic] to keep them quiet now even.

            Letters and Letter-Writing   
            
         </h3>
         
         <p><strong>The Art of Early Twentieth-Century Letter Writing</strong>. “A well-written letter,”
            writes Lord Chesterfield in the 1857 edition of his popular manual, <cite>Chesterfield’s Art of Letter Writing</cite>, “has opened the way to prosperity
            for many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and constant friendship, and has
            secured many a good service .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for it is in some measure a photograph
            of the writer and may inspire love or hatred, regard or aversion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just as a glimpse
            of a portrait often determines us in our estimage of the worth of the person
            represented” (6-7). In his manual Chesterfield
            follows in a tradition of placing import on letter writing perhaps argued most early
            and fervently by Scottish rhetorician Hugh Blair. In his 1783 century rhetorical
            treatise <cite>Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</cite>, Blair establishes
            letter writing as a employing the same teachable rhetorical skills of good taste and
            facility as other types of composition. By the turn of the century and the time of
            the <cite>Stephens Family Travel Letters</cite> hundreds of letter
            writing manuals and etiquette books were being written and read, covering genres
            from the business letter to condolences on the breaking of an engagement. During
            this same time period, letter-writing among the middle class in the United States
            had been on the rise for some years. Nineteenth century changes in etiquette,
            education, travel, and commerce led to a culture that allowed, even required,
            correspondence to become central to social interactions.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Accessibility and Affordability of Letter-Writing Materials</strong>. Perhaps most important in
            allowing wider access to personal correspondence were the Postage Acts of 1845 and
            1851, which lowered the cost of long-distance postage by connecting price to weight,
            rather than mileage (Schultz 111).
            Accessibility of materials was also a major factor as emerging consumer culture “was
            fuelled by the onward rolling development of mass production, more efficient
            materials, efficient distribution and marketing, which generated changes in the
            nature of letter writing equipment” (Hall 91).
            In the letters written by Stephens and McIntyre, we can see the effects
            of the increased production of letter-writing materials, particularly in the printed
            stationery they both use. Starting at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
            stationery began to include decorative headings: “The decorative personal letter
            writing papers most frequently held views of places. This was no accident and did
            not develop for aesthetic reasons. It is a reflection of railway development and the
            increased potential for travel. Souvenir shops supplied much of this stationery, but
            a lot was also available in hotels, a tradition which still continues today”
            (Hall 98). Although most letter-writing
            manuals from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries recommend using
            plain, unlined paper for personal letters, the easy accessibility of hotel
            stationery, as well as its status as evidence of one’s travels, may have been
            appealing to a new traveler like Stephens, especially as she wrote to family members
            back home who had probably not visited these locales. For McIntyre,
            accessibility while on board ships and cost were possibly two reasons that he would
            sometimes choose to use Alaska Steamship Company stationery, rather than more
            conventional note paper.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong>Natural vs. Artistic Style in Letter Writing</strong>. Many composition manuals and etiquette guides of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
            centuries
            portray correspondence as a social practice with very defined rules, a practice that
            would reveal the 
            character and training of the letter-writer. For example, Kingsland writes in her
            1903 <cite>Book of Good Manners</cite>, 
            “A letter tells more than the news it contains or the sentiment it expresses, – it
            is a revelation of the 
            character and culture of the writer, and although the matter depends upon mental and
            moral qualities, 
            the manner may be acquired by any one” (375). The letters in this 
            collection, when read alongside instructions for polite and appropriate social correspondence,
            seem to 
            go against many of the accepted standards. For example, Stephens, who writes about
            contracting head lice in 
            Mexico and points out many of the faults of Adelaide’s fiancé, seems to be ignoring
            Kingsland’s directive against 
            writing about unpleasant things since “A letter carries with it an atmosphere, and
            the mood of the writer is contagious. 
            Write kindly of every one” (389). Stephens’ constant stream of gossip, while not necessarily 
            unkind, might not be considered completely appropriate. McIntyre, on the other hand,
            has not fully attended to advice 
            about using correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling: “The character of the one
            addressed should be considered, and 
            the contents of the letter adapted to his tastes and temperament.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mistakes in
            language or little 
            slips in the use of a verb, which may be overlooked in speaking, offend all our sensibilities
            when written” (Kingsland 388). 
            McIntyre has many “little slips” and even seems to introduce intentional errors with
            words like “fink” (think). 
         </p>
         
         <p>While these letters at times appear to defy standards, they may exemplify other aspects
            of advice to writers, which 
            often appeared alongside the admonitions cited above. For example, Kingsland leads
            into her warnings by saying, “Do not 
            be hampered by conventionality. Listen to your own thoughts and express them, even
            if they seem crude” (387). 
            And immediately after stating that errors “offend all our sensibilities,” she adds
            that “The recipient of a letter is by
            courtesy bound to suspend all criticism – he must not even think deprecatingly of
            a letter received. 
            Many hesitate to write, fearing criticism” (388). McIntyre does not seem 
            to have feared such criticism from Stephens, and Stephens seems to feel free to express
            her (perhaps crude) thoughts openly, 
            at least when writing to her mother.
         </p>
         
         <p>This contradiction in the advice about letter-writing has been pointed out by Schultz:
            “Toward the end of the century, 
            a number of writers recognised that the rules for letter writing they offered were
            ‘custom’, not transcendent. But I see 
            no writers who recognised that their claim that letters should be ‘simple, natural,
            and easy’ – descriptive terms that 
            appear over and over in chapters on letter-writing – were elaborate masks for very
            complex and artificial constructions or 
            that an elaborate irony was embedded in that instruction” (121). White’s 
            <cite>Twentieth Century Etiquette</cite> clearly demonstrates this contradiction: “Write as you would talk were 
            your correspondent present. Try and think over what you intend writing, and say it
            in the most natural way you can. This is 
            the highest art – to do everything in so artistic and finished a manner, that it will
            have the appearance of being a second 
            nature” (234). In writing these letters, Stephens and McIntyre seem to be 
            following the first part of this advice, to view writing as a conversation, while
            sometimes disregarding the need for letters 
            to be “artistic and finished.” McIntyre’s long, rambling sentences with little to
            no punctuation, and Stephens’ string of gossip 
            about neighbors and friends, resemble a conversation more than they do the polished
            model letters that appear in composition texts of the time.
         </p>
         
         <p>The main reason given by most manuals for taking care in writing letters was the potential
            longevity  of the manuscript. Kingsland advises, 
            “Never write anything over your signature of which you might later be ashamed. Our
            letters are often longer-lived than ourselves, and may eventually 
            be read by eyes not yet open to the light” (388). Wells gives an even stronger warning: “beware, and be even over-cautions, 
            rather than not cautious enough, for a letter may serve as a sure witness in cases
            where you might never suppose it could be used. It may live and bear testimony for
            
            years – it does not change with time or circumstance – it is a warrantee deed of whose
            responsibility you can never be free” (194-195). 
            These warnings, at least in the case of the Stephens family letters, were somewhat
            justified in that these letters are still being read, and now transferred 
            into digital format, over one hundred years after they were written. However, Stephens’
            letters to her family are perhaps more 
            interesting to readers today in that they express her feelings and details of her
            daily life honestly, without ornamentation or censoring.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Travel and The Familial Letter</strong>. For the Stephens family,
            letter-writing was essential for staying in touch with far-flung family and friends,
            particularly for Gladys as she traveled across the United States to places that
            would not have been accessible to travelers before the nineteenth century. Schultz
            explicitly connects such travels to changes in the postal system: “Both cause and
            effect of this increased accessibility [to letter writing] was that the need for
            long-distance communication was increasing. As the Westward expansion continued, and
            as the Midwest and South became more populated, the personal correspondence of many
            US residents increased” (111). While the
            increased ease and comfort of travel allowed for greater distances between people,
            personal correspondence maintained close ties between family members: “Throughout
            the nineteenth century, migration across the North American continent compelled many
            people to become letter writers, challenging them to image the genuinely vast
            physical distances traveled and to affirm – through a space and time that
            annihilated fellow travelers – connection with those they hoped their letters would
            reach” (Decker 88). By sharing items of gossip,
            day-to-day events, and descriptions of people and places with her parents and
            others, Stephens created a sense of home even while far away.
         </p>
         
         <p>Especially following the
            debilitating effects of the American Civil War, the nation turned to the familial
            unit to heal. As rhetorical historian Nan Johnson writes, “the celebration of the
            American home and its promise for salvation for the nation…its potential to heal
            ‘disasters’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [were demonstrated] by courting a nostalgia for
            domesticity” (Johnson 90). Though Stephens writes
            to her mother and father more than forty years after the war has ended, the
            importance of the familial unit had not lost its hold. With the increasing problem
            of alcoholism and intemperance as argued by the Anti-Saloon League, Prohibition
            Party, and Women’s Christian Temperance movement, the maintenance of a close family
            was of dire importance. When a family member like Stephens left home, it was of keen
            importance, therefore, to maintain a sense of family through letter writing. Richard
            A. Wells argues in his 1894 <cite>Manners, Culture and Dress of the Best
               American Society</cite>, “Family correspondence is a great social privilege as
            well as a great necessity. It brings together divided members of the household, and,
            for the while, gives home a place in their hearts. Women always write these best…”
            (Wells 183). Serving this purpose of
            familial transport, the drives for clarity, perspicuity, and, above all, simplicity
            represented in these manuals takes on a new tenor—one should sound like oneself and
            “avoid all ‘stereotyped and stilted language’” in order to follow the oft repeated
            adage that letter writing was “simply to converse on paper, instead of by word of
            mouth” (Sheldon 27;Wells
            182). Thus, while antibellum letter manuals suggest more formal
            address between child and parent, post-bellum manuals argue for the less formal more
            casual style we see in Stephens’ letters home.
         </p>
         
         <p>Though Stephens might have been able to phone home when she was closer to Newton,
            
            for those used to writing letters, the telephone seemed too casual—“A note 
            of invitation requires answer by post; such a missive should not be dismissed by 
            telephone or telegraphic"—or too formal—“why the telephone which seems 
            more intimate [is] in reality more formal? We say something just to say something
            &amp; 
            yet underneath are striving” (Roberts 473;Rothman 224). 
            One also had to take care of what was said over the telephone for fear the operator
            
            was listening in. And, yet, letter writing manuals also cautioned that one should
            not 
            write anything that one didn’t want a third party to read, for letters, especially
            letters 
            home, were often read aloud among family members. It is interesting, then, that Stephens
            pens 
            several relatively uncouth and gossipy statements (by the manuals’ standards, at least)
            to 
            her mother regarding the monetary situations of those she meets, her weight, her sunburn,
            etc.

         <p><strong>The Love Letter</strong>. Taking caution about
            unintended readers was specifically advised regarding the love letter. As
            Chesterfield warns, “Always compose your love-letters in a style that you would not
            be ashamed to have them fall into the hands of a third party” (57). Sheldon adds, arguing for the natural style
            mentioned above, that overly-florid language won’t help anyway because “no wise
            woman’s heart is won by silly flattery. On the contrary, insipid compliments tend
            only to disgust her” (Sheldon 55). And yet,
            Sheldon also warns to men, “Be not too humble in your utterances, as great humility
            borders closely upon servility, and no right-minded woman desires a slave for a
            husband” (56). As this last line suggests, the
            love letter and love letter manuals are rich places to explore gender relations of
            the early-1900s.
         </p>
         
         <p>For instance, in McIntyre’s
            letters to Stephens (we have no letters of hers to him) we often see him telling
            Stephens that she makes him “determined to do better” (10.11.09). As Ellen K. Rothman
            explains in her <cite>Hands and Hearts: A History of Courtship in
               America</cite>, women were thought to have morally purifying powers upon men who
            were “impelled by ‘animal instincts’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Women could—indeed,
            must—help men in the struggle for self, control” (186). One love letter Rothman quotes sounds very similar to
            McIntyre’s in its statement, “You are my good influence to keep me pure in
            heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your influence makes me more manly” (187). Yet
            as Rothman and Johnson argue, “the doctrine of female influence had long served to
            justify the subordination of woman: she did no need the vote since her innate
            superiority gave her so much influence” (Rothman
            189). Because women were seen as the paradigm of self-control and
            lodestones of morality, Rothman goes on, “The late nineteenth century view was that
            women, although more emotional and sensitive than men, loved less intensely”
            (200). Thus, beyond Stephens simply not
            sharing McIntrye’s feelings, this learned repression might be one reason for
            McIntyre’s querying, “I wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being
            of quite a different desposition [sic] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of
            mind and you not so much so” (8.20.09). This feminine temperance and control might
            also be an explanation for the little tests of love McIntyre seems to set up: for
            instance, he asks “I wonder what influence it would have on you to have some one put
            up an [argument?] against me” (9.11.09). He also, seemingly to stir up Stephens’
            passions, mentions in passing at least twice other women coming after him (9.11.09
            and 10.4.09).
         </p>
         
         <p>The role of the ideal woman
            was to resist and purify (sometimes to the point of being defined as “rhetorically
            meek”) and the role of the ideal man was to balance wooing and being purified
            (Johnson 48). Within his wooing, however,
            the manuals suggest that a man still needs to maintain his manliness through
            avoiding “all exaggeration of statement and profusion of endearing epithets which
            characterizes morbid sentiment and makes one appear ridiculous” (Sheldon 56). McIntyre clearly does not heed this
            advice, consistently using his favorite epithet “Little Girl” to refer to Stephens.
            But Rothman suggests that this advice was typically not heeded, stating that,
            “‘little girl’ was not unusual. Beginning around 1880, couples began to use ‘little
            girl’ and ‘little boy’ as terms of endearment. It seems logical that men and women
            raised in the increasingly child-centered, emotionally dependent families
            characteristic of late Victorian middle classes would associate intimacy with the
            parent-child relationship and feel comfortable addressing each other by a term that
            evoked the closeness and dependency of childhood” (Rothman
            206).

         <p><strong>Men and Romantic Love</strong>.
            Some of the most prominent themes that we notice working in the Stephen family letters,
            particularly through the intimate relationship 
            between James J. McIntyre and Gladys Stevens deal with romance, desire, and a longing
            to be near loved ones. Although we do not know 
            all of the details of their relationship, in his love letter to Gladys on August 21st
            1909, James J. McIntyre opens up the possibility 
            for the representation of emotional culture at the time. In their article “Men and
            Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th-Century Change” Peter 
            N. Stearns and Mark Knapp reinforce and document the theme of love for American middle-class
            men while also discussing dating practices from 
            the Victorian period onto the Early 20th century. (Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th-Century Change)
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            From his letters to Gladys, we certainly do know that James J. McIntyre was of working
            class status. He often mentions his experiences 
            and duties on board ship as a merchant marine, which included keeping watch at night,
            travelling along the Pacific Northwest, and following 
            orders from both the Chief and Captain on board. Less is known about his physical
            appearance, at least nothing is mentioned in this one letter, 
            but he does recall his youth and reflects on how he used to go out dancing with his
            friends, which tells us that he was certainly a social person. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            What we notice from his love letters to Gladys, is that McIntyre is writing within
            a larger social context dealing specifically with love ideals 
            for men. By the nineteenth century, men were redefining male standards for love arguing
            that 
            "“it was only through love that their true selves could 
            shine through”"
             (Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th Century Change) Although McIntyre is writing at a 
            later time, these cultural standards shaped the way for multiple decades after the
            19th century. Indeed, as we see in his letters, McIntyre often 
            talks about how much he misses Gladys. Historically, men in and around the time that
            this letter was written, accepted 
            "“the pain that love could 
            bring, sometimes noting their jealousy when a lover showed interest in others, even
            more commonly citing their grief when a loved one was absent”"
            . 
            In his letter, McIntyre makes it clear that he wants to be near Gladys: 
            "“here we are Dear me plowing along miles farther away every day when it is 
            my desire to be with you”"
            . We do not know if Gladys had more than one love interest but in this case it seems
            like her and McIntyre had a working 
            romance going on before and during his life as a merchant marine. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            By the Early 20th century, which is when McIntyre wrote to Gladys, new trends were
            emerging for men in terms of their commitment towards women. 
            According to Stearns and Knapp, 
            "“What was beginning to happen, by the 1920’s, was a virtual reversal of Victorian
            notions: whereas in the 19th 
            century men had accepted the principle of deep love in a context of substantial differentiation
            and separation from women, they now enjoyed more 
            routine contact but devised a less committed version of romance in compensation”"
            . (Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing 
            a 20th-Century Change). One of the reasons for this change was in part because there was a growing separation
            between work and home. 
            Indeed, McIntyre was separated from Gladys, but with a difference: not because he
            was not committed, but due to the kind of work he did that prevented 
            him from close contact. In fact, McIntyre seems to be the opposite of not being committed,
            he holds Gladys in high esteems and he longs to be with her.

         <p><strong>Railroads and The Promotion of Tourism in the American West</strong>. The letters written by Gladys Stevens, documenting both the ordinary and extraordinary
            details of her various excursions, prompt readers to make inquiries of different kinds
            about the nature of tourism in the first decade of the twentieth century.  
            On one hand, we wonder about Gladys the person: what were her reasons for taking an
            extended trip into the Pacific Northwest, how did she as a young single woman have
            the means to do so, and who were her fellow travelers?  On the other hand, however,
            
            Gladys’s letters inspire a curiosity about the place itself: how would a traveler—any
            traveler—have imagined the Pacific Northwest in 1909?  Given the centrality of the
            American west to the ethos of American exceptionalism, and the powerful myths of 
            the frontier that shaped American thought so profoundly throughout the nineteenth
            century, what cultural and political forces would have been at work in 1909 to shape
            a tourist’s experience of an increasingly modernized frontier?
         </p>
         
         <p>It seems important at this point to give a brief account of the ways that people experienced
            greater mobility in a new region— the ways that the west became more accessible physically
            to new groups of tourists in Gladys’s time. Perhaps the most 
            important railroad presence in the region, The Union Pacific Railroad would connect
            the essentially "foreign" country of the Pacific Northwest to the well-developed urban
            east.  United with the Central Pacific line in Utah in 1869, the Union Pacific 
            Railroad not only achieved the distinction of becoming the first transcontinental
            railroad in the United States, but heralded itself as a symbol of national unification
            and patriotic spirit in tense post-war years.  Thwarted by the tough terrain of 
            the Rocky Mountains, sectional tensions among its converging routes, and attacks from
            the Native American tribes who were displaced by railroad construction, the process
            toward completion was arduous.  However, the Union Pacific ultimately made it 
            possible to travel from New York City to San Francisco in only ten days.  By the final
            years of the nineteenth century, it had become not only a vehicle for freight, but
            for people, and a new era of tourism began in the American west.  When the Union 
            Pacific faced bankruptcy in 1897, railroad baron E.H. Harriman purchased the company,
            and in 1901 he initiated a series of aggressive infrastructural improvements to the
            Overland Route, the principal passenger train line.  With hundreds of new miles 
            of double track and shortened routes, the Union Pacific was restored to prominence
            and profitability.  Although Gladys does not explicitly mention that she traveled
            west by rail, it is a reasonable assumption; a cross-country trip in an automobile
            
            would have been unlikely (and daring) in 1909.  As we try to imagine the world in
            which Gladys lived and the means by which she moved through it, these climactic years
            for the railroad industry offer a compelling context in which to place her.  
            She was traveling in the west at a time when people could travel vast distances with
            speed, safety, and perhaps for the first time ever, in comfort(n.p.).
         </p>
         
         <p>However, of equal importance is the way that the west was opened imaginatively to
            tourists at the turn of the century.  The very railroad companies that made it possible
            for new groups of Americans to see the west for themselves also played 
            an incredibly prominent role in the perpetuation of a certain image of the American
            west.  Of principal interest are the See America First campaign launched by civic
            leaders in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wonderland series issued by the Northern
            
            Pacific Railroad from 1883 to 1906.  (27)The See America First advertising campaign began simply as a slogan created by Fisher
            Sanford Harris, a passionate community advocate and local politician in Salt Lake
            City.  Eventually, his slogan became the most 
            recognizable creed of the national parks in America.  Citizens interested in
            developing a thriving tourist industry in the west “used See America First not simply
            as a booster slogan to promote the idea of a cooperative tourist organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
            but 
            more broadly as an expression of western regionalism in response to the centralizing
            forces that were reconfiguring the emerging urban industrial nation-state” (Shaffer 560).  “See America First” went from being a headline in the Salt Lake Telegram 
            in 1905, to the proper designation for a league of delegates and fundraisers devoted
            to promoting tourism in the west, and eventually could be found on every billboard
            advertising the Great Northern Railway.
         </p>
         
         <p>See America First was intimately connected to the spirit of American exceptionalism.
            “Nationalist Americans,” Marguerite Shaffer writes, “looked to the American landscape
            with its abundant national resources and magnificent scenery to compensate 
            for America’s lack of an ancient past.  Scenic and sublime wilderness in America
            offered a natural legacy representative of American .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. superiority over Europe”(565).  Harris’s brainchild was originally conceived as a means of interesting American
            
            middle-class and upper-class citizens in domestic travel; countless American dollars
            were being spent by an emergent leisure class on sightseeing in Europe, and westerners
            believed that the American frontier was the answer to the problem.  In similar 
            fashion, and perhaps broader in cultural scope, was the Northern Pacific Railroad’s
            “Wonderland” series.  Borrowing from the title of Lewis Carroll’s popular book, the
            Northern Pacific Railroad Company issued a volume each year between 1883 and 1906
            
            that featured various attractions of the Pacific Northwest.  Some of the issues were
            devoted specifically to different Pacific Northwest localities, like Yellowstone Park
            or the Inland Passage in Alaska.  Others treated the region traversed by the 
            railroad as a whole.  The booklets included propagandistic descriptions of the landscape
            and vivid illustrations designed to lure travelers to ride its rails(n.p.).  It is difficult to imagine that, somewhere along her journey, Gladys would not
            have seen 
            one of the See America First billboards, or that she grew up in a literate middle-class
            family without ever leafing through one of the Wonderland books that would have certainly
            captured the imagination of an independent young woman.
         </p>
         
         <p>Also important to our understanding of Gladys’s cultural perspective, with respect
            to the presence of railroads, is our understanding of the effect they had on defining
            a region.  Because of railroads, the Pacific Northwest became the next entrepreneurial
            
            endeavor of America’s modern economy.  However, John M. Findlay notes that “the
            railroad companies’ efforts to create a distinct regional identity may have counted
            for more.  To be profitable in the Northwest, they needed to attract [people] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
            
            to ride their trains .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the companies launched continual publicity campaigns to
            sell Oregon, Idaho, and Washington as a single region called ‘the Great Northwest’”(Shaffer 51). 
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 and Destination Travel
               to Yellowstone Park</strong>. Like many World's Fair expositions at the turn of the century, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific
            Exposition of 1909 (AYP) was a destination to 
            which many people would travel vast distances. As mentioned above, Gladys (originally
            from Massachusetts) 
            likely travelled west to the AYP Exposition by rail. Glady’s visit to Yellowstone
            Park en route to the fair 
            suggests that she rode the Northern Pacific Railroad, which actively advertised its
            sleeper car service from 
            St. Louis to Yellowstone as an en-route destination to the AYP Exposition.  Visitors
            could lay over at 
            Yellowstone Park as part of a Seattle-bound itinerary for no additional charge from
            the Northern Pacific 
            railroad. During their visit to Yellowstone, an elaborate set of stagecoach routes
            and resort-style hotels 
            ensured that well-off visitors could spend days sightseeing the park in comfort and
            style (37-40).  Thus, in her 
            travels to the AYP Exposition, Gladys travelled through an idealized American West
            that was largely 
            constructed by the emergent tourist industry; the version of Yellowstone Park that
            she encounters is 
            almost as intricately engineered and maintained as the AYP Exposition itself.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Although the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (AYP) Exposition of 1909 was particularly focused
            on promoting commerce 
            and tourism in the Pacific Northwest, it can and should be contextualized in terms
            of a larger Exposition 
            culture in America and around the world.  The fair takes place 58 years after the
            first such event, The Great Exhibition in 
            Hyde Park, London in 1851, and 56 years after the first American Exposition held in
            New York City in 1853.  
            Like many American expositions, the AYP was originally conceived as a commemoration
            of an American historical event.
            The 1876 Centennial Exposition commemorated the Declaration of Independence; the Chicago
            World’s Fair 
            commemorated the arrival of Columbus in America; the 1904 St. Louis Exposition commemorated
            the Louisiana 
            Purchase; and the 1905 Portland Exposition commemorated the westward journey of Lewis
            and Clark (6). 
            Indeed, this larger exposition culture ultimately affected the AYP’s reimagining from
            a 1907 celebration of the 
            1897 Klondike Gold Rush to a 1909 celebration of Pacific Northwest commerce and tourism;
            the AYP Exposition 
            was moved from 1907 to 1909 partly to avoid conflict with the 1907 World’s Fair in
            Norfolk, Virginia that 
            commemorated the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement.(9)

            As a Northern Pacific Railroad brochure advertising the AYP shows, the exposition
            ultimately downplayed its 
            relationship to the Klondike Gold Rush:
            
            <br>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition is based upon no historical incident.  
            <br>It is simply and frankly a broad, commercial proposition, but it will be 
            <br>just as full and complete, just as educative and valuable and satisfying 
            <br>as if it commemorated the most profoundly impressive event in our national
            <br>history. (6)

            Whether Gladys had been to any other World’s Fair expositions is unknown, but Gladys
            suggests in her 
            letters that at least some of her upper-class travel companions have been to other
            expositions.  
            Nonetheless, with an estimated attendance of 3.7 million people, the AYP Exposition
            undoubtedly attracted 
            a range of visitors from many walks of life and socioeconomic classes.  Advertisements
            for the exposition 
            corroborate this range of attendees: for example, 1909 Northern Pacific Railroad pamphlet
            reminds readers 
            that they can contact the Exposition’s travel bureau by mail regarding the size of
            their travel party and 
            their budget, and in exchange, the travel bureau will “return a list of addresses
            of the class of 
            accommodations required” (27).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition was constructed on 250 acres on the grounds of
            the University of 
            Washington and was located approximately 20 minutes’ ride by streetcar from downtown
            Seattle.  
            The University of Washington had struggled to expand at the same rate as Seattle’s
            fast-growing population, 
            and although many of the AYP buildings were designed to be temporary, the University
            of Washington claimed 
            and used many AYP buildings after the fair’s conclusion.  Most of the elaborate landscaping
            originally designed by John Olmsted has been built over in the subsequent century,
            
            but the University of Washington campus continues to bear the overall layout of the
            AYP 
            Exposition grounds.  For example, the main thoroughfare of Rainier Avenue continues
            to bisect the campus and point 
            to the iconic Mount Rainier; each side of the fairgrounds is still bordered by scenic
            man-made lakes (n.p.).

            In some regards, the AYP Exposition was a typical American World’s Fair: like many
            other such fairs, it had a busy midway
            (called the “Pay Streak”) that included side shows, fair rides such as a roller coaster
            and ferris wheel, 
            dancing, food, and risqué sideshows. A number of travelling exhibits common to other
            World’s Fairs reappeared 
            at the AYP Exposition, including an exhibit of baby incubators for infants born as
            early as 6 to 7 months’ 
            gestation; buildings and exhibits finances by other states who wished to promote their
            industries 
            (Pennsylvania, for example, financed a mining exhibit); buildings extravagantly designed
            in a wide range of 
            architectural styles; and brilliant electric displays that illuminated the fair until
            midnight each night (n.p.).  
            In other regards, however, the AYP was unique among World’s Fair Expositions.  The
            AYP's strong focus on the Pacific Northwest 
            region’s commerce and industry influenced many of its exhibits, including the Forestry
            Building that Gladys 
            describes in detail in her letter from July 10th.  The Northern Pacific Railroad’s
            promotional pamphlet for the fair states the AYP Exposition’s goals:
            
         </p>
         
         FIRST: To exploit the resources and potentialities of the Alaska and Yukon territories
         in the United States 
         and the Dominion of Canada.
         SECOND: To make known and foster the vast importance of the trade of the Pacific Ocean
         and of the countries 
         bordering thereon.
         THIRD: To demonstrate the marvelous progress of Western America, where, within a radius
         of 1,000 miles of 
         Seattle, 7,500,000 persons live who are directly interested in making the exposition
         the true exponent of 
         their material wealth and development. (5)
         
         
         <p>
            In accordance with these goals, Washington state’s major Pacific trade partner of
            Japan had a strong 
            presence at the fair.  According to the documentary film <cite>Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition: Seattle’s Forgotten World’s Fair</cite>, 
            Ships from the Japanese Navy docked at Puget Sound, the Japanese tea house was a 
            popular attraction with visitors, and Japanese dignitaries visited the fairgrounds.
            The AYP was also a 
            product of its unique historical moment: for example, the AYP was held just six years
            after the Wright 
            Brothers’ historic first flight and airplanes were thus a popular exhibit item at
            the fair. The 
            controversial win (and subsequent disqualification) of a Ford Model T in the AYP Exposition’s
            
            New-York-to-Seattle automobile race helped launch the popular Ford Model T in the
            American market (the vehicle made its debut approximately 9 months earlier in September
            1908).  
            Women’s suffrage activists from around the country converged on AYP Exposition to
            lobby for women’s right 
            to vote, and perhaps partly because of their efforts, Washington State granted women’s
            suffrage the next 
            year in 1910. Whereas many previous American Expositions had made most of their money
            selling alcohol, 
            the AYP was a 
            "“dry”"
             fair—partly because of its placement on the University of Washington Campus, which
            
            was dry by law.  Nonetheless, the AYP turned a financial profit and was considered
            a success in its own 
            time (n.p.).

         <p>
            In one of her letters, Gladys mentions a feature of turn-of-the-century Expositions
            that modern readers 
            may find troubling: the display of what Gladys calls 
            "“bare natives”"
             in exhibits such as the Hawaiian 
            Building, the Igarotte Building, and the Eskimo Building.  Native peoples were often
            displayed at 
            Expositions such as the AYP, sometimes taking the form of side-show-like displays
            in which visitors 
            could view the natives engaged in leisure activities and sometimes in the form of
            active stage shows 
            involving fights, sport displays, or simulated Cowboy-and-Indian battles.  These exhibits
            were explicitly 
            part of a larger Western imperial project and were meant to show visitors that the
            native peoples that 
            the Western powers colonized could benefit from the technological and social progress
            on display elsewhere 
            on the Exposition grounds.  Recent historians, however, have suggested that the relationship
            between
            native peoples and these exhibits is more complex and nuanced than it may at first
            appear: for example, 
            the AYP’s Igarotte Building featured exhibits by the indigenous Igarotte hill people
            from the Phillippines, 
            a troupe that appeared regularly at many World’s Fairs and were financially compensated
            for their 
            performance through a hired business manager.  The AYP Fair Queen was an Inuit girl
            who had grown up 
            appearing in Eskimo exhibits at World’s Fairs; in exchange for financial compensation,
            she and her 
            family would pose for photographs in front of a plastic igloo at the Eskimo Building.
            In other words, 
            some of the native peoples involved with American Exposition culture were consciously
            choosing to put 
            themselves on display for profit, thereby gaining financial and social gain from a
            system that aimed to 
            exploit and denigrate them (n.p.).
            
         </p>
         
         <p><strong>Seattle, a Rapidly Expanding City</strong>. In 1909 the young Gladys Stephens made her way to Seattle as part of a series of
            destination 
            visited in anticipation of the 1909 World Fair, also known as the Alaska Yukon-Pacific
            Exposition,
            in Seattle.  But what sort of city was Gladys entering?  We see in her letters mentions
            of her 
            life in Seattle and all it entailed, but scant detail is paid to the city itself,
            its history, 
            and the peculiar time in which she visited.  Seattle during this period had grown
            continuously 
            backed by the latest and last Gold Rush in the United States, the Klondike Gold Rush
            of 1897-1898 
            described at length by Lisa Mighetto and Marcia Montgomery in <cite>Hard Drive to the Klondike</cite>.
            The Klondike Gold Rush was itself in Alaska, however Seattle’s position in the extreme
            northwest of the 
            continental United States and previously developed port on Puget Sound made it invaluable
            as a transition 
            point for those moving to Alaska to mine, and those returning with or without gold.
            As a result of the 
            Gold Rush Seattle became a hotbed for a number of industries supporting the influx
            of males looking to 
            strike it rich.  This included a burgeoning saloon industry, illegal gambling interests
            and businessmen 
            promoting prostitution and later pornography as described by Richard C. Berner in
            <cite>Seattle 1900-1920: From Boomtown
               , Urban Turbulence, to Restoration.</cite>(5)  Approximately 100,000 miners were attracted by 
            the Gold Rush, and some 70,000 of them passed through Seattle, nearly doubling the
            previous population 
            of the city.(17)  By the end of the next decade the influx of population and gold had led 
            to a rapid increase in the boundaries of the city itself as wide swaths of land to
            the south of Elliott 
            Bay were annexed as well as territory to the extreme north of the city.(1944)  By 1910 the 
            cituy had grown from a population in 1880 of 3,533 to 237,194, an increase far exceeding
            many other 
            American cities during the same period. (1959)  Into this bustling hotbed of activity the 
            young Gladys Stephens likely had far more to see and do than is accounted even in
            her letters.

            In Seattle Gladys would have found a bevy of men, a boisterous nightlife, and a city
            in the process of 
            transforming itself.  Although Seattle continued to be a coal and wood-burning city
            during this period 
            beautification became a significant priority, leading to the creation of a comprehensive
            park plan for 
            the city, developed by the Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts. (104)  The park system 
            developed piecemeal while focusing on the acquisition of land focused on tracts with
            views of the water, 
            mountains and woodlands.  This park system would have constituted the primary means
            for Gladys Stephens 
            to move about the city as the parks were connected by parkways, which became bridle
            paths for the horse 
            set and for carriages, boulevards. (105)  In addition to movement about the city, Gladys was 
            quite interested in the World’s Fair, and would have been a frequent visitor to the
            Fair on its site 
            amidst the new campus of the University of Washington.  The University, originally
            located downtown had 
            moved its campus to the shore of Lake Washington, just east of Union Bay, in 1894.
            Its new site was on 
            the periphery of the city proper, meaning that construction efforts involved clearing
            forest, supplying 
            utilities and so forth.(82)  It was the Exposition itself that came to be the means of a 
            continual increase in the University’s capabilities and reputation as its selection
            as the site of the 
            Exposition in 1906 funneled funds into such departments as the forestry, journalism,
            domestic science 
            during a time when the Washington state legislature resisted financing the continued
            construction.
            (84-85)  In the midst of great economic and social development Gladys Stephens encountered
            a 
            city as much in the growing stages of its life and she herself was.  Neither fully
            formed, both still 
            vibrant and ever-changing, Seattle proved to be a powerful site motivating frequent
            correspondence with 
            Gladys’ circle of family and acquaintances, correspondence that led to the collection
            of the Stephens 
            Family Letters today.

         <p><strong>Shipping and Tourism in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest</strong>.
            The 1895 <cite>Lewis &amp; Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest</cite> reports 
            that 
            "Russia's transfer of Alasksa to the United States in 1867 enlarged the field of marine
            
            operations in the North Pacific"
             (155). The purchase included 
            the Russian steamer <i>Politkofsky</i> (156), 
            foreshadowing the role that steamer vessels were to play in the exploration, colonization,
            
            commercialization, and tourism of the Alaskan frontier. Additionally, the <cite>Marine 
               History</cite> records that "[t]he most important event of [1889] was the
            organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the 
            Puget Sound and Alaska Steamship Company" (363), for which 
            James J. McIntyre sails and works on the <i>Santa Clara</i> and 
            <i>Northwestern</i>, among other ships, in 1909.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Within the selected letters presented here, McIntyre never explicitly mentions the
            potential dangers of his work, 
            but the wreck of the S.S. Ohio informs some of his remarks about various ships. In
            his September 13 letter, 
            he mentions an acquaintance who was the "Chief from the S.S. Ohio." We do not know
            if McIntyre ever served on the Ohio, 
            but it had just wrecked on a reef off the coast of Alaska a few weeks earlier, killing
            five people 
            ("Wreck of the Steamship Ohio" 14). McIntyre himself would have been involved 
            with getting some of the surviving passengers to their original destination, had he
            not transferred from the Santa Clara to 
            the Northwestern when he did. His August 13 letter describes the transfer, the Ohio
            wrecked on August 26, and the Santa Clara 
            left port with passengers from the Ohio on August 30 ("Steamer Portland"). 
            The contemporary account even mentions that the Santa Clara's next stop would be in
            Juneau to pick up survivors from 
            another shipwreck, that of the steamer Humboldt.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            The contemporary article that mentions the Santa Clara also holds interest for a reader
            of McIntyre's letters because it sheds 
            some light on the activities of the ships on which he served. Before the Santa Clara
            had been dispatched to help out the 
            survivors of the Ohio, it had been "idle for three months" ("Steamer Portland"). Thus, 
            when McIntyre refers to the Santa Clara as a "mail boat" in his August 13 letter,
            we can infer that it was not actively engaged 
            in shipping mail when he wrote the letter. The Santa Clara may have had a contract
            with the Post Office at the time, but its idleness 
            helps explain why McIntyre ends that same letter with the word "lightboat." If the
            Santa Clara were serving as a lightboat, or lightship, 
            during those months of inactivity, then it was helping to keep the coast safe by operating
            as a kind of lighthouse upon the water. 
            Such an operation must have been subsidized by the government, but it begs questions
            about how much money the crew and the steamship company 
            made for such services. These circumstances also highlight the numerous purposes of
            the merchant marine during this time. The state of U. S. 
            shipping required steamship companies to come up with various and wide-ranging modes
            of income. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            McIntyre indicates that his ships are involved in the freight business, especially
            with the rapidly 
            expanding canning and salmon industries. In <cite>The American Year Book</cite> of 
            1910, Emory R. Johnson and G. G. Huebner explain that 
            "[t]he American merchant marine engaged 
            in the coastwise and inland trade trade has increased for many years, while that engaged
            in the 
            foreign trade has gradually declined."
             The Atlantic and Gulf region saw more than three times 
            the steam vessels than the Pacific coast, however, and steam vessels in the Northern
            lakes region 
            carried approximately 63% more freight tonnage than those on the Pacific coast (522). 
            Furthermore, between 1908 and 1909 the number and tonnage of ships constructed on
            the Pacific coast decreased 
            by 23% and 60%, respectively (524). 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Beyond commerce, the steam vessels in the Pacific Northwest also carried tourists
            to Alaskan destinations. 
            <cite>A Trip to Wonderful Alaska</cite>, a promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship 
            Company, boasts that 
            "the cruise along the Southeastern coast of Alaska is by far the more picturesque"
             
            than 
            "the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence,"
             and that 
            "the voyage to the North is more instructive 
            than a tour of the Old World and the scenery which the tourist beholds surpasses the
            Alps of Switzerland 
            in its mighty and rugged grandeur."
             McIntyre hikes to the lower and upper waterfalls of the Ketchikan 
            River with Irene Palmer, the sister of the <i>Northwestern</i>'s purser, and Gladys 
            Stephens, and he writes to Gladys of the forthcoming totem park at Klawock. Alaskan
            Indian culture was quickly 
            becoming a featured tourist attraction, driven by a perceived enervation of traditional
            cultures and the 
            preservation efforts to counteract that enervation which, ironically, was a product
            of American intrusion.

         <p><strong>Salmon and Resource Economies in Alaska</strong>.
            JJ McIntyre's letter on Sep. 13, 1909, details the cargo freighted on the Black Ball
            Line 
            from Alaska back to the lower 48 states. In that freight is 126 heads of cattle and
            3 mules,

            in Alaska.
            Interestingly, this freight is onboard at the same time as 3000 cases of salmon. The
            former 
            seem to be supplies brought northward from the lower 48 to service the Alaskan outposts,
            the latter seem
            to be freight brought southward to bring the frontier's bounty back to serve a growing
            nation.
            In fact, McIntyre's described trajectory from Ketchikan to Taku and onward to Chilkoot,
            Gypsum, Sitka, and 
            Belling Run is a loop that moves generally southward on the second leg. So, at times,
            the ship 
            would normally have freight for both the northern and southern ends.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            All of this is to indicate the intensive co-dependent relationship of northern and
            southern markets. 
            Rene De La Pedraja writes that the northern and southern ends of the Alaska route
            were conventionally 
            divided by two local monopolies: the Alaska Steamship Company and the Alaska Coast
            Company(10). But in 1914,
            after the time of these letters, the Alaska Coast Company became the Admiral Line,
            which was destroyed in 1933
            by competition with the Alaska Steamship Company (11). The Alaska Steamship
            Company had incurred traditionally in the Alaska Coast Company's territory when its
            ships were idle due to 
            the seasonal nature of Alaskan shipping. Pacific-borne freight in the early 20th century
            often suffered from a trade imbalance, which very 
            physically impacted shipping routes. De La Pedraja notes (175)
            the Dollar shipping company resolved its freight imbalance by shipping Chinese passengers
            in freight
            and skirting the law by flying the British flag. After having dominated Alaska-based
            freight, the Alaska Shipping 
            Company handled 85% of south-bound cargoes, imposing high prices on its primary customers,
            salmon canneries (11).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            This anecdote indicates the troubled relationship between the law and inter-territorial
            traffic, from the lower 48
            to Alaska. At the height of the Progressive Era, the Federal Government struggled
            with regulating inter-territorial commerce
            and its now-threatened natural resources. Since the beginning of salmon fishing in
            Alaska, fishers recognized the threat
            of depletion (3). The obvious solution to this problem at the time was to found salmon 
            hatcheries in Alaska, invented in 1763 in Germany and first practiced in the United
            States in 1866(3). 
            But quickly, hatcheries and canneries had to account for the continued ecological
            collapse. Because fishers continued 
            to deplete salmon runs at the same time that hatcheries were running, these two methods
            were viewed as complements rather than supplements: 
            in the words of Patricia Roppel, 
            "Why stop fishing when a hatchery would in theory replenish the runs?"
            (5-6).
            Over time, the multiple bodies involved--fishers, hatchers, canners, and politicians--all
            proposed different solutions to 
            depletion. As of the 1900 revision of the 1899 fisheries act, all persons removing
            salmon from Alaskan waters
            were required to establish a hatchery that produced at least four sockeye fry, which
            are today called sac-fry or alevin, for every
            salmon removed (9). Unfortunately, because the cannery buildings were 
            "often on sites where
            water was of poor uqality and quantity, where insufficient numbers of salmon returned
            to provide eggs for incubation, or where 
            high water destroyed the structures"
             (9), the law became even more convoluted in response.
            After a 1902 bill on salmon culture, the US federal government took possession of
            all water and fish in Alaskan streams
            and extending 4 miles into the tidewater: the Treasury leased the product of the home
            stream to fishermen, while natives were allowed to 
            fish for food, not commerce, from the streams (12). But all of this was overturned again in 1906,
            with a bill that superseded the act of 1899 and instead provided a tax-and-rebate
            system to promote private hatcheries. All salmon
            canned in Alaska were levied four cents a case, while hatcheries received a rebate
            of forty cents for every ten cases of salmon fry
            released (15). The combined effect of this was that salmon companies would only incur levies 
            by an estimation error, that is, if they managed to miscalculate how many salmon they
            would catch and produce. The Alaska Packers
            Association in 1907 canned 806,808 cases of salmon but only paid 32 cents in taxes,
            which they paid with stamps.

            Clearly, by the time that JJ McIntyre loaded 3000 cases of salmon onto the Black Ball
            Line, salmon was a colonial enterprise
            dedicated to extracting the maximum of resources from the Alaskan territory for the
            longest possible time. Assuming that the people 
            who removed 3000 cases of salmon from Alaska had not offset their levies with rebates,
            the cases on McIntyre's boat were only taxed
            120 dollars in sum, or about 2744 dollars in today's money (CPI Inflation Calculator). The ghostly 
            presence of native fishers in Congressional law is the exemption that proves the rule:
            the government of the colonialists only feels the need to 
            makepassing reference to the original fishers. It goes without saying that Roppel's
            book contains no mention of compensation or reparation,
            and the index doesn't even make any mention of natives or Indians.

            JJ McIntyre's perspective is predicated on the US imperial naval position in the early
            20th century. In his same letter on September 13,
            he references China, Japan, and Manila, all of which had some kind of colonial relationship
            with the US. Under the Treaty of Paris, the 
            United States purchased the islands from Spain. Whether JJ McIntyre was present in
            East Asia as a member of the US Navy cannot be known, 
            but even if he was part of the Merchant Marine, his travels still represent a period
            of outright economic colonialism.

         <p><strong>The Decline of the U.S. Merchant Marine at the Turn of the
               Century</strong>. Contemporary sources trace the decline of the merchant marine back to the American
            Civel War and its aftermath. 
            In an issue of The American Marine Engineer from 1915, an article titled 
            "The American Merchant Marine" significantly quotes secretary McCulloch to 
            help explain the waning U. S. shipping industry (despite the fact that McCulloch 
            served under President Lincoln, and the last time he had held that position was 1885).
            
            According to the anonymously written article, McCulloch blamed various domestic policies
            
            as well as tariffs for status of U. S. shipping: 
            The decline of American shipping commenced with the substitution of iron for wooden
            ships. 
            It was hastened by our refusal to permit our shipowners to protect their ships by
            a foreign flag 
            during the war, by the tempting opportunities of railroad development: the finishing
            blow being given to 
            it by a tariff which by taxing the materials that are used in the construction of
            ships, made them too costly to invite 
            capital in that direction and forced it into manufactures. These conditions directly and indirectly 
            resulted from the Civil War, and they continued to plage the merchant marine for half
            a century. 
            The article goes on to explain that in 1850, 75% of maritime shipping in the U. S.
            was done by American ships, but by 1864, 
            the figure plummeted to 27%. By 1896, it was down to 11%, and by 1914, it reached
            a low of 8.6% "The American Merchant Marine". 
            The impact of World War I on European shipping allowed for a resurgence in the U.
            S. merchant marine; however, when J. J. McIntyre 
            is writing about his life as a merchant marine in 1909, the industry had reached an
            unprecedented low point. 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Congress attempted to mitigate the decline of the merchant marine with the passage
            of the Ocean Mail Act of 1891, otherwise known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1891.
            
            Congress had already taken previous actions to subsidize individual steamship companies;
            however, as Rene De La Pedraja notes, 
            this was "the first general subsidy bill passed by Congress since the pre-Civil War
            period" (452). The act 
            positioned the Post Office to consider bids and renewals for five and ten year contracts,
            which, as De La Pedraja observes, 
            "halted but did not reverse the downward trend in the U.S. merchant marine" (452). Ships built in the United States were quite 
            expensive at the time, so the act only benefitted the larger, more established steamship
            companies. Also, the subsidies 
            themselves were apparently only moderately enticing because, of the fifty-three mail
            routes that the Post Office sought bids for, 
            they received only eleven proposals (De La Pedraja 452). Nonetheless, by the turn of the century, private companies in the 
            merchant marine were shipping mail across both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Thus,
            when J. J. McIntyre refers to the 
            Santa Clara as a "mail boat" in his letter from August 13, he underscores one of the
            primary functions of the merchant marine 
            at the time.

         <p><strong>Social Status of Maritime Workers</strong>.
            Of interest to diverse readers will be the curious love affair between James J. McIntyre
            and Gladys Stephens. 
            In fact, upon reading McIntyre's letters, one must wonder how James McIntyre, a crewmember
            on the S.S. Northwestern 
            and Gladys Stephens, a lady of some means and social mobility, could have ever met
            and fallen in love. McIntyre’s 
            correspondence with Stephens does not provide much information regarding how the two
            met or indeed, 
            how their very different lives ever crossed paths. Given that 
            they both seem to have lived in Seattle and refer to it often, it is possible that Stephens and McIntyre met there. However,
            this is not confirmed in their 
            correspondence. However, based on the collection of letters that we have, 
            it is certain that McIntyre feels passionately about his “little girl” Gladys and
            he tells her this numerous 
            times in his love letters. At the center of their romance is a budding intrigue—McIntyre
            often mentions his 
            concern that Stephens’s family will disapprove of him and of their relationship. The
            man is clearly conscious of 
            a great disparity in their social stations and thus an overwhelming sense of his own
            inadequacy preoccupies McIntyre 
            in his writings. As a crewmember on a ship, McIntyre worries that he will be perceived
            as a man of low class and that 
            he will be judged harshly according to contemporary stereotypes about sailors. Indeed,
            in his August 23rd, 1909 letter 
            to Stephens, he attempts to prepare his love for the harsh judgments that she may
            face: 
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            
            "one off the many things that you will be told is this honey He’s only a seafaring
            man. And I will admit that their Rep. 
            is none too good but that comes more from the sailor class on war ships and sailing
            vessles and all deap water crafts 
            mostly foreigners and dear I hope too be through with this in the near future..."
            
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            McIntyre’s explanation of the distinctions among the different types of ship crewmen
            provides us with a fascinating window 
            into both the man’s concept of himself and also the complex social strata for laborers
            on merchant ships. Indeed, Anglo-American 
            historians have often advanced the notion that social relations on ships were harmonious
            in spite of differences in rank and file 
            among the ship's crew. However, around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
            social 
            stratification among the different workers was evident. In fact, the workforce of
            the steamship now consisted of three different 
            crews, which were the sailors on deck, the firemen below stoking the steam boilers,
            and in the passenger lines, the stewards in the 
            catering and housekeeping sectors(178). Since McIntyre was most likely a tramp engineer 
            (a form of unsteady employment that required few skills, and was poorly paid), he
            probably would have belonged to the stoking crew, 
            which was widely regarded as the lowest rank of unskilled labor(179). This crew and all 
            other nontraditional forms of steamship employment in the early 1900s suffered significant
            disparagement from the sailors on deck, who 
            considered themselves as the only true sailors left. McIntyre's desire to differentiate
            himself from other sailors and their bad reputations 
            is interesting from a critical perspective. It may indicate the man's sensitivity
            regarding his low station on the ship and his desire to elevate himself 
            above other crewmembers that likely discriminate against him. 
            
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            His desire to set himself apart from other seafaring men suggests that McIntyre is
            attempting to carve an identity for himself 
            apart from his profession — or at the very least, that he is trying to convince Stephens
            that he is different from other men in his position. 
            In his attempt to distance himself from the lot, however, McIntyre more often follows
            expected behaviors for sailors in the late 
            nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. David Cordingly reminds us that sailors’
            writing homesick letters to their wives and 
            girlfriends was a typical activity for men working on merchant ships. As he remarks,
            
            "“sailors spent, and no doubt still do spend, 
            a great deal of time thinking of women…and above all they wrote letters to their women.
            These letters are often heartrending to 
            read and show that the happy-go-lucky sailor was often desperately homesick and wanted
            nothing more than for the voyage to end so 
            he could return to his loved ones at home” "
             (xiii). Perhaps unfortunately for McIntyre, therefore, his expressions of love and 
            desire for his Gladys may have come across as mere 'sailor talk' to his best girl
            at home.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            While McIntyre’s anxiety may at times seem more indicative of his own insecurities
            than of stringent social realities, it may also 
            be justified. In his August 23rd letter, McIntyre inquires whether Gladys has told
            her mother about their relationship. The clear 
            concern with which he inquires about this matter suggests that he anticipates a disastrous
            outcome to the revelation of their love 
            that will surely become an obstacle in their relationship. Yet, most telling of the
            blatant difference in their positions is the fact 
            that Stephens remains suspiciously quite about her relationship with McIntyre. Not
            only does she seem to correspond with McIntyre less 
            often than he writes to her—which could mean that she does not share his strong feeling
            of love—but she also makes no mention of him at all 
            in her letters to her relatives. In fact, while she reports writing to several friends
            and relatives while on her travels, we do not 
            have any such first-hand accounts of Stephens’s ineractions with and feelings for
            McIntyre.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Of course, Stephens’s possible unconcern for McIntyre is largely speculative because
            we do not have her letters to McIntyre and thus 
            we cannot be sure about how many times she wrote to him (or what she might have said
            in those letters). We can glean from McIntyre’s letters 
            that he is a bit frustrated by his not receiving any letters from his “dear” Gladys,
            but he does not reveal whether this is because of his 
            traveling from port to port on numerous different ships – or if in fact he suspects
            that his “neddy” is snubbing him. The apprehension that 
            he sometimes betrays in his writing is certainly understandable: Numerous contemporary
            sources describe the unfavorable reputation of sailors 
            and other ship crewmen. These describe this class of men as swarthy, crass, uneducated
            and unfaithful. In fact, by the early nineteenth century, 
            the warning that 
            "a sailor has a wife in every port"
             was a well-worn saying (xiii). Gladys is likely aware of these stereotypes about sailors, whose 
            reputation is “none too good,” and her apparent silence may be an indication of her
            hesitation to pursue the relationship. Nonetheless, the letters 
            from James McIntyre to Gladys Stephens provide a fascinating glimpse into what might
            have once been a steamy love affair between two individuals of 
            highly different social stations – and it is likely to raise a few eyebrows.

         <p><strong>The Tramp Engineer</strong>.
            It's probable that McIntyre was a tramp engineer, a low-skill worker with little or
            no formal training 
            and who moves from job to job and company to company with little warning or loyalty.
            In his letter of 
            04 October 1909, he indicates that he has been a tramp engineer on five different
            ships that year. 
            Understandably, the tramp engineer drew criticism in the same way that low-skilled
            and unpredictable 
            workers still do, but he also had his champions. In the July 1907 issue of <cite>The American 
               Marine Engineer</cite>, for example, a pseduonymous author declares that 
            "it's the tramp experience 
            that teaches a man to do impossible things. It's the tramp engineer, a thousand miles
            from port, with a 
            monkey wrench, a cold chisel, a file, and a ratched brace that rebores a cylinder,
            puts in a new furnace 
            or does some other equally impossible stunt that the mail boat engineer would only
            dream of after a 
            welsh rarebit supper"
             (20).
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            The itinterant and unprivileged nature of the position, though, were difficult to
            mask with braggartism, 
            and McIntyre seems to voice discontent when he writes that he has had enough changes
            for one year (04 October 
            1909). On the other hand, McIntyre did not sail internationally and therefore did
            not have to endure 
            the long absences from home that receive a sarcastic send-up in the May 1914 issue
            of <cite>The 
               Sailors' Magazine</cite>: 
            "[d]on't think that I am grumbling; sure not. Why, a little over three years 
            ago I saw my wife, and had the good fortune to be in her company for almost the whole
            of an hour"
             
            (74). Regardless, the job was dangerous, and the tramp engineer 
            would likely be assigned the riskiest manual labor. McIntyre expresses that because
            the <i>Northwestern</i>'s 
            boilers have been acting up, it will be 
            "a wonder"
             if no one is seriously injured (04 October 1909).

         <p><strong>U.S. Perceptions of Mexico</strong>. Just as tourism between the Mississippi and Pacific shaped and reflected conceptions
            of America and the American 
            west, tourism and travel writing constructed a Mexico that validated the definition
            of the United States as a 
            benevolent, civilizing, superior force. Travelogues such as Mary Blake and Margaret
            Sullivan's 
            Mexico, Picturesque, Political, Progressive, published in 1888, and T. Philip Terry's 
            Terry's Guides to Mexico, first published in 1909, defined Mexico and Mexicans as either
            quaint and exotic or dangerous and degenerate. The travelogues frequently used descriptions
            of dress,
            to define Mexican identity. Gladys's descriptions of Mexico reflect the topics and
            attitudes of 
            these travelogues. Her observations about Mexican clothing as either exotic costume
            (when she describes the tight 
            pants and large hats of Mexican men) or a mark of uncivilized behavior (as in the
            case of the "peon women" who don't 
            wear corsets and the children who sometimes don't wear clothing) illustrates the fetishizing
            and denigrating 
            catigorization found in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century travelogues.
            Such attitudes also reflect the 
            inherent attitude of superiority in turn-of-the-century philosophies of Manifest Destiny
            and American expansion.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>For all that the United States professed a policy of splendid isolation in the late
            nineteenth and early twentieth 
            centuries, the United States the government rigorously pursued U.S. economic and political
            interests in Mexico and 
            Central and South America, at times supporting revolutionaries and regimes materially,
            financially, and politically. 
            This unofficial policy of political support for the United States' commercial interests
            abroad provided impetus for 
            the 1909 Taft-Diaz meeting in El Paso and La Ciudad Juarez. On October 16, 1909, President
            William Taft of the United 
            States and President Porfirio Diaz of Mexico met to discuss the political and economic
            relationship between the United 
            States and Mexico. Taft was particularly concerned that Diaz would continue his support
            of the United States' economic 
            interests in Mexico, as Mexico's civic unrest threatened to disturb the farms and
            businesses of the United States 
            within Mexico. In 1909, Diaz's position in Mexico was becoming increasingly unstable;
            in 1910, the country erupted in 
            revolution and civil war as multiple factions fought against Diaz and each other.
            In her letter to her mother dated 
            September 22, 1909, Gladys Stephens comments on the rising political unrest in Mexico
            and on her excitement for the 
            anticipated presidents' meeting. Gladys's presence in El Paso and Mexico approximately
            one month before Taft and Diaz 
            met places her accounts of the political situation in Mexico within the larger context
            of the relationship between the 
            United States and Mexico on the eve of the Mexican Revolution. Gladys's comments about
            the Rurales as necessary to keep 
            civic order and her statements that the rising civic unrest is directed against the
            fear of Reyes taking power rather 
            than Diaz's regime reflect the current favorable attitude of the United States towards
            Presiden Diaz.

         <p>Title: "The Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera" 
            <br>Extent: 15 signed autograph letters.
         </p>
         
         <p>This edition of fifteen signed, autograph letters offers a
            necessarily selective view of the 899 separate items listed in the finding aid for
            the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of Stephens Family Letters and Ephemera held in the
            Rare Books and Manuscript collection of The Ohio State University Libraries
            (SPEC.RARE.CMS.327). Half of the items in the collection are letters, most of which
            are accompanied by stamped, addressed envelopes, and most of the letters are
            relatively short: 376, or 84% of the letters, consist of 1 or 2 leaves. Postcards
            constitute the next largest group of items—191, or 21% of the total—followed by 140
            miscellaneous documents, including 33 name cards and various bills, receipts, and
            brochures. Finally, the collection includes 110 small photographs. The 622 dated
            items range from 1834 to 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date from between 1907
            and 1914, with another 3% from 1917. Ten of the 110 photographs are dated, the dates
            scattered through the years covered by the letters.
         </p>
         
         <p>Detailed physical and bibliographical descriptions of the
            materials contained in this electronic edition appear with the letters in the
            edition. More general information about the format of the other materials in the
            collection appears in the Libraries' finding aid, which can be downloaded
            <a HREF="http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/finding/StephensFamilyLetters.xls" alt="Link to finding aid for Stephens Family Travel Letters." target="blank">here</a>. All of the materials are, to the best of the editors'

            The finding aid identifies 180 different individual and corporate correspondents or
            authors, and 24 different correspondees, but Gladys Stephens emerges unquestionably
            as the central figure in the collection: she is listed as the recipient of 334 of
            the letters and 138 of the postcards, and as the author of 54 letters and
            postcards. The letters in the present edition were all
            written during the summer and autumn of 1909 by Gladys Stephens (8), James J.
            McIntyre (6), and Cora Anderson (1).

         <h3 id="projectDescription">Project Description</h3>
         <p>
            
            <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth and early twentieth-century American
               manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised), "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
               William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
               height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864, and "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by
               Samuel Sullivan Cox. These documentary editions are intended
               to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
               for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
               for studying those texts. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The texts were edited in connection with graduate and undergraduate courses offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when cultural materials and archives spread from page to
               screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.
            </p>
            
            <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <i>sine qua
                  non</i>, the Stephens edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical documents, the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the texts, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system.
            </p>

         <h3>Editorial Method</h3>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
            images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
            full quality before being loaded into an image server that provides zoomable views
            of the
            production images. All edges of manuscript pages were
            overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages under neutral
            indoor
            lighting.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Production Location of Digital Assets</strong>. The TEI XML-compliant
            transcription of the Stephens letters, along with the XSL style sheets used to provide
            variant "views" of the edition, are stored on a server hosted by College of
            Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State University. High resolution scans of the manuscript
            pages, scans of plates from contemporary sources, and photographs of the letters are
            stored in the Media Manager application hosted by the College of Arts and Science
            at
            The Ohio State University. The files constituting the project's Web site are also
            stored on a Web server hosted by the College.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Archiving of Digital Assets</strong>. Once the edition is complete,
            its digital assets will be archived in The Ohio State University's institutional
            repository, the
            <a HREF="https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/" alt="Link to the Knowledge Bank" target="blank">Knowledge Bank</a>.
            
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</strong>. The manuscript
            <strong>pages</strong>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
            element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
            &lt;pb&gt; element includes an "facs" attribute identifying the unique ID
            of a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <strong>Line
               breaks</strong> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the physical
            constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are encoded
            with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the &lt;lb&gt;
            element. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Markup of Textual Structure</strong>. The edition employs TEI's corpus
            structure, encoding information relevant to the entire editon in a &lt;teiHeader&gt;
            element with an attribute-value pair "type='corpus'"; information about the
            individual letters as well as the encoded transcriptions of the letters are contained
            in
            separate &lt;TEI&gt; elements, each with its own &lt;teiHeader&gt; and &lt;text&gt;
            elements. <strong>Letters</strong> and any accompanying <strong>envelopes</strong> are
            encoded by &lt;div1&gt; elements with the attribute-value pair "type='letter'"
            and "type='envelope'", respectively.Each letter contains
            an &lt;opener&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;closer&gt; elements encoded according to TEI
            guidelines.
         </p>
         
         <p>The body of each letter consist of a series of <strong>paragraphs</strong>. Where indicated
            by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
            a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
            &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Level of Transcription/Encoding</strong>. The edition's markup scheme supports
            a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
            The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
            (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
            as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
            nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations.The project's Web site contain
            full details of the markup
            guidelines:

         <p><strong>"the man"</strong>.
            Adelaide's fiance. Gladys never refers to 
            him by name, but tells her mother about his income ($50 per week) 
            and drinking habits (
            "the man"
             prefers a good cocktail at his club)
            in her letter postmarked September 24, 1909. He may also be known as 
            
            "the Scotchman."
             In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 23 August 1909, James J. McIntyre 
            asks about "the Scotchman" and wonders whether this man is 
            "brooke."
             If the
            Scotchman is indeed Adelaide's fiance, this question could be a joke about recent
            
            wedding costs.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Cora L.</strong> (b. 1877).
            Cora writes to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, her aunt, on August 19, 1909, to tell her about
            the birth of her son. She also inquires about Gladys Stephens' travels.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Gladys</strong> (b. 1903).
            Gladys Anderson is Cora Anderson's daughter. She's mentioned in Cora's letter to Mrs.
            A. T. Stephens on August 19, 1909.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Willis D.</strong> (b. 1876).
            Willis Anderson is Cora Anderson's husband. He's mentioned in her letter to Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens on August 19, 1909.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Willis Goodwin</strong> (b. Aug. 4).
            Willis Goodwin Anderson is Cora Anderson's son, both in August of 1909. Cora writes
            to Mrs. A. T. Stephens on August 19, 1909 to tell her about Willis' birth, although
            his name is not mentioned in the letter..
         </p>
         <p><strong>Burns</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Diaz, Jose de la Cruz Porfirio</strong>.
            In her letter to her mother postmarked
            September 24, 1909, Gladys discusses the political tension in 
            Mexico due to Pres. Diaz' advanced age and the upcoming election. 
            Gladys spells "Diaz" as "Dias." President Diaz was exiled from 
            Mexico in 1911, not long after the start of the Mexican Revolution 
            in 1910, the year following Gladys's visit.

         <p><strong>Florence</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Hiser, Henry</strong>.
            
            After a night of drinking, Henry Hiser crashed an automobile carrying approximately
            seven 
            passengers and fled the scene "Two Girls Burned and Crushed 
            Beyond Human Resemblance". James J. McIntyre refers to this accident in his letter 
            to Gladys M. Stephens of 04 October 1909, and insists that he has moved on from such
            a lifestyle.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Holland, Mr.</strong>.
            JJM's letter to GMS on 8-13-1909 repeatedly mentions Mr. Holland as someone who 
            served as a kind of guide to Gladys while she was in Portland.

         </p>
         <p><strong>Jones, Mr.</strong>.
            James J. McIntyre's letter on 8-13-1909 mentions Mr. Jones as an acquaintance of Gladys's
            from 
            back home.

         <p><strong>Macphearson, Adelaide M.</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Maud</strong>.
             In a letter dated September 13, 1909, J Macyntire describes travelling with a person
            from Montana named Maud.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Maynard</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>McIntyre, James J.</strong>.
            James J. McIntyre is a crewmember on the S.S. Northwestern. 
            He is enamoured with Gladys Stephens and writes to her often between the summer of
            1909 and 
            the fall of 1909 (and probably later). It's likely that McIntyre was a tramp enginner,
            a low-ranking 
            crewman who switches jobs frequently and has little formal training. Between his letters
            of 13 August 
            1909 and 04 October 1909, McIntyre transfers from the <i>Santa Clara</i> to the 
            <i>Northwestern</i>, and in the latter letter, he indicates that in one calendar 
            year he has worked on five different ships.

         <p><strong>Miss Campbell</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mrs. Dana Gibson</strong>.
            
            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes travelling with a Virginian named
            Mrs. Hughes who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor.  Mrs. Dana
            Gibson is likely a reference to Irene Langhorne, originally of Danville, Virginia.
            She married graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson in 1895.  Charles Dana Gibson was the
            creator of the iconic Gibson Girl sketches.  Popular history suggests that Irene Langhorne
            (wife of Charles Dana Gibson) and her sister (Nancy Astor nee Langhorne, married to
            British politician Waldorf Astor) were the inspirations for the Gibson Girl.

         <p><strong>Mrs. Duff</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mrs. Hughes</strong>.
            
            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes travelling with a Virginian named
            Mrs. Hughes.  Mrs. Hughes is described as the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs.
            Waldorf Astor as well as the cousin of a Mrs. Jordon who has two sons.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mrs. Jordon</strong>.
            
            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes Mrs. Jordon as a cousin of Mrs.
            Hughes (one of Gladys' travelling companions, a Virginian.)  Mrs. Jordon is described
            as having two sons and a dead husband.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mrs. L</strong>.
            
            A Mutual friend of Gladys and her mother, Mrs. L lives in El Paso presumably near
            Gladys.
            In one letter 1909-09-06, ATS has made a pillow and sent it to Gladys to give to Mrs.
            L.
            In another letter (27 September 1909), Gladys comments to her mother that she is teaching
            Mrs. L. to make 
            Boston Baked Beans.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mrs. Waldorf Astor</strong>.
            
            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes travelling with a Virginian named
            Mrs. Hughes who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor.  "Mrs. Waldorf
            Astor" likely refers to Nancy Astor, wife of British Member of Parliament for Plymouth
            Sutton, Waldorf Astor.  Nancy Astor became the first female Member of Parliament when
            she succeeded her husband as MP for Plymouth Sutton in 1919; she served until 1945.
            Along with her sister, Mrs. Dana Gibson (nee Irene Langhorne), Nancy Astor served
            as inspiration for the iconic Gibson Girl sketches penned by her brother in law, Charles
            Dana Gibson.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Nims, Mabel</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Palmer, Herbert E.</strong> (b. June 1876).
            
            In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre speaks of spending
            
            time with the S.S. Northwestern's purser's sister, whom he identifies as Irene Palmer.
            
            Though McIntyre never mentions the purser by name, the 1900 U.S. Census shows that
            Irene 
            Palmer lived with two older brothers: Gilbert S. and Herbert E. Palmer. The 1910 Census
            
            indicates that Gilbert S. Palmer was still a member of the family household, while
            Herbert 
            E. Palmer is not listed, suggesting that the purser of whom Macintyre speaks is Herbert
            E. 
            Palmer. In fact, a Herbert E. Palmer corresponding with the relevant genealogical
            data 
            does not appear at all on the 1910 Census, but this is not surprising if we consider
            that 
            the itinerant nature of his duties on the Northwestern could have prevented his being
            
            recorded for the 1910 Census. It's likely that he didn't die during this gap, as a
            Herbert 
            E. Palmer matching the relevant genealogical data is recorded in the 1920 Census.
            At this 
            point, he had married Mary Palmer, a first generation Bohemian-American whose parents
            
            emigrated from Bohemia, and the two lived in Pierce County, WA, which includes the
            greater 
            Tacoma area. The 1930 Census shows that Mary had died and Herbert had moved to Richmond,
            
            NY, though it also incorrectly estimates his birth year as 1877. It's likely that
            even though 
            McIntyre refers to Herbert as Irene Palmer's brother, he was in fact her half-brother.
            
            The 1930 Census indicates that both of Herbert's parents were born in Massachusetts,
            while 
            the head of the Palmer household, Gustavus Palmer, was born in Maine. Herbert's mother,
            
            Minnie T. Palmer, was born in Massachusetts, and didn't marry Gustavus until 1882,
            
            approximately 6 years after Herbert's birth 
            United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1910; United States Census, 1920; 
            United States Census, 1920;
            United States Census, 1930.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Palmer, Irene</strong> (b. September 1892).
            
            In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre identifies
            
            Irene Palmer as the sister of the Purser on the S.S. Northwestern, and indicates 
            that she is 17 years old at the time of the letter. The 1900 U.S. Census records 
            that an Irene Palmer was born in September 1892 in Anderson Island, Washington, 
            which corroroborates her age in Macintyre's letter. The 1900 Census also shows 
            that Irene had two older brothers, which corroborates Macintyre's description of her
            
            as the only girl in her family. The 1910 U.S. Census records Irene Palmer's city of
            
            residence as Tacoma, which would likely be her city of residence a year earlier at
            
            the time of Macintyre's letter dated 04 October 1909. Tacoma's proximity to the Alaska
            
            Steamship Company's headquarters in Seattle argues for the plausibility of Irene Palmer
            
            hitching a ride to spend time with her brother and to see the landscape of the Pacific
            
            Northwest 
            United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1910.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Pauline</strong>.
            In her letter to her mother on October 5, 1909, Gladys mentions that she has written
            to Pauline but still needs to mail the letter.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Philys</strong>.
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Reyes, Bernardo</strong>.
            In Gladys's letter to her mother postmarked 
            24 September 1909, she mentions the Mexican people's opposition 
            towards Vice-President Reyes.

         <p><strong>Smith, Berenice</strong>.
            
            A Mutual friend of Gladys and her mother, Berenice Smith is mentioned as being a person
            that Gladys
            might get to check in on her mother if she doesn't write back on 06 September 1909.
            So Berenice Smith presumably
            lives in Newton near ATS.

         <p><strong>Stephens, Albert T.</strong> (b. est. 1856).
            
         </p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Alex C.</strong>.
            In the letter dated August 8, 1909, Gladys 
            mentions her "Uncle Alex" a number of times.  It is apparent that he is facilitating
            social connections for her in Texas, prior to her arrival, so we can assume he lives
            in El Paso.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Gladys Mary</strong> (b. est. 1892).
            A Gladys Mary Stephens from Newton, MA appears in lists of "Special Students"
            in the <cite>Boston University Yeark Book</cite> for 1907 and 1909, but
            not for 1908. According to the <cite>Year Book</cite> for 1907, students
            could be admitted as special students if they were "taking one or more particular
            course of work, without being a candidate for a degree," were "deficient on prelimiary
            preparation," or had "not passed the full number of examinations required for
            admission" to the class to which they sought admission. Special students were
            classified in three groups, and Stephens appears in lists of the first group (Group
            A), "those enrolled in the College [of Liberal Arts] only" (special students in the
            other groups were enrolled in "Teachers' Courses" or in other departments of the
            University.
