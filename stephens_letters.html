            And this
            leads to another law—never to keep a letter, if possible. If it be interesting
            beyond the usual, it probably has in it some things which had better be forgotten.
            If it is commonplace, it is not worth the keeping. Old love-letters are often
            profaned by careless eyes; old gossip is raked up. Of course there are
            exceptions—charming letters with no sting in them. But they are exceptions. If all
            letters were burned as soon as answered, there would be that much less trouble in
            the world—as any lawyer can testify.<br><br>— Priscilla Leonard, "The Laws of Letter
            Writing" (<cite>Harper’s Bazaar</cite>, November 1904)
            
            <br></p>
         
         <p> As any historian,
            rhetorician, or casual reader of personal letters—whether those of ancestors or
            historical figures—can testify, if people followed Priscilla Leonard’s advice in
            "The Laws of Letter Writing" to burn letters as soon as they are answered, our
            personal and cultural histories would be poorer to the degree that the threads of
            any one individual’s experiences, perceptions, and practices contribute to the
            entire fabric of the past. More specifically, had Gladys M. Stephens (b. 1892?) and
            her family
            followed Leonard’s advice, we would lack the rich tapestry of information about
            travel, tourism, commerce, courtship, and personal correspondence in the first
            decades of the twentieth century contained in the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of
            Stephens Family Letters and Ephemera housed in the Rare Books and Manuscripts
            collection at The Ohio State University Libraries (the dated items in the collection
            were written between 1834 and 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date from the
            decade before the U.S. entry into World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I). 
            </p>
         
         <p> Stephens emerges as the
            central figure in the 899 separate items in the collection. She is the recipient of
            334 of the 449 letters in the collection and 138 of the postcards, as well as the
            author of 54 letters and postcards. Presumably, we can thank her for violating
            Leonard’s law. We know little of Stephens's life beyond the experiences recorded in
            the letters. She was born in Newton, MA, attended Boston University in 1907 and 1909
            as a "special student" (<cite>Year Book</cite>), and is listed in the 1920 U.S. Census as single
            and living at her parents' home in Newton. In the summer of 1909, at the age of 17,
            she set out on a cross-country trip that took her from Newton to Seattle—with a stop
            at Yellowstone National Park—to visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and travel
            via steamer up the Inside Passage of southeast Alaska. At some point along the way,
            she met James J. McIntyre, a "tramp engineer" employed by the Alaska Steamship
            Company, and, judging by his letters to her, formed a romantic relationship with
            him. From Seattle, Stephens travelled via California to El Paso, TX to visit an
            uncle, arriving in the midst of revolutionary unrest in neighboring Mexico.
            </p>
         
         <p> This edition of selected
            letters from the collection presents fifteen letters written during the summer and
            fall of 1909, eight written by Stephens to her parents about her travels, six by
            McIntyre to Stephens in which he describes his work on various merchant ships and
            professes his love for Stephens, and one by Stephens’s cousin Cora Anderson to
            Stephens’s mother in which she inquires about Stephens. Together, these letters
            represent three of the four genres of letter writing for which Priscilla Leonard
            offers laws: the personal letter, the social letter, and the love-letter—depending,
            of course, on how one limns the boundaries of the genres. As is the case with any
            personal correspondence, these letters invite at least two vectors of
            interpretation: how the writers understand and employ the genre and material
            practices of letter-writing, and how the writers’ words constitute a window looking
            onto the wider world. Students of epistolary rhetoric will find much of interest in
            the Stephens letters. For example, in "The Laws of Letter Writing" Leonard cautions,
            <br><div class="blockquote">[W]hen we
               must commit our fortunes to a written page, to be read, perhaps at an unpropitious
               moment, hundreds of miles away, it behooves us to know how to make that written
               page say what we would, and make the exact impression we desire. (1125)
               <br></div>
            </p>
         
         <p> As if he had read and
            absorbed this caution, James McIntyre seems acutely aware of the dangers of making
            the wrong impression in his letter to Gladys Stephens of 21 August 1909: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">[H]ow I
               wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being of quite a different
               desposition [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of mind and you not so
               much so.
               <br></div>
            </p>
         
         <p> And in a letter to her
            mother written on 6 July 1909 from Seattle, Stephens reflects, as she often does in
            her letters, on her own and others’ attention to the social obligations of letter
            writing: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">Havent
               [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] done much on the writing stunt. I wrote Miss Childs a steamer letter, one to
               Gus, I think I wrote one to Roswel, and a dozen lines to Nat telling him that I
               was having a dandy time—never knew where I was going next and did not know when
               I'd be home; and hoped that he'd have as pleasant a summer as I was having. Found
               nothing at the P.O. Gee! but I'd like to hear.
               <br></div>
            </p>
         
         
         <p> Students of early
            twentieth-century history will also find much of interest in the letters, from
            McIntyre’s accounts of life on merchant vessels plying Alaska’s Inside Passage to
            Stephens’s accounts of traveling through Yellowstone National Park by stagecoach,
            visiting the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle, and observing political
            unrest in Mexico:              
            <br><div class="blockquote">Uncle
               says I must stay to see the Presidents meet and then I can go home immediately
               after that. He says Dias [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] is so old (79) that I probably will never get another
               chance to see anything of the kind again. A revolution in Mexico is imminent if
               Dias [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] dies. The Vice Pres. Reyes wants to be Pres. and the people hate him
               terribly. They have to have Rurales every where [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] to keep them quiet now even.

            Letters and Letter-Writing   
            </h3>
         
         <p><strong>The Art of Early Twentieth-Century Letter Writing</strong>. “A
            well-written letter,” writes Lord Chesterfield in the 1857 edition of his popular
            manual, <cite>Chesterfield’s Art of Letter Writing</cite>, “has opened
            the way to prosperity for many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and constant
            friendship, and has secured many a good service .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for it is in some
            measure a photograph of the writer and may inspire love or hatred, regard or
            aversion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just as a glimpse of a portrait often determines us in our
            estimage of the worth of the person represented” (6-7). Chesterfield follows in a tradition argued perhaps earliest
            and most fervently by Scottish rhetorician Hugh Blair. In his 1783 rhetorical
            treatise <cite>Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</cite>, Blair argues that
            letter writing requires the same teachable rhetorical skills of good taste and
            facility as other types of composition. By the turn of the century, hundreds of
            letter-writing manuals and etiquette books were being written and read, covering
            genres from the business letter to condolences on the breaking of an engagement.
            During this same time period, letter-writing among the middle class in the United
            States had been on the rise for some years. Nineteenth century changes in etiquette,
            education, travel, and commerce led to a culture that allowed, even required,
            correspondence to become central to social interactions.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Accessibility and Affordability of Letter-Writing Materials</strong>. Perhaps most important in
            allowing wider access to personal correspondence were the Postage Acts of 1845 and
            1851, which lowered the cost of long-distance postage by connecting price to weight,
            rather than mileage (Schultz 111).
            Accessibility of materials was also a major factor as emerging consumer culture “was
            fuelled by the onward rolling development of mass production, more efficient
            materials, efficient distribution and marketing, which generated changes in the
            nature of letter writing equipment” (Hall 91).
            In the letters written by Stephens and McIntyre, we can see the effects
            of the increased production of letter-writing materials, particularly in the printed
            stationery they both use. Starting at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
            stationery began to include decorative headings: “The decorative personal letter
            writing papers most frequently held views of places. This was no accident and did
            not develop for aesthetic reasons. It is a reflection of railway development and the
            increased potential for travel. Souvenir shops supplied much of this stationery, but
            a lot was also available in hotels, a tradition which still continues today”
            (Hall 98). Although most letter-writing
            manuals from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries recommend using
            plain, unlined paper for personal letters, the easy accessibility of hotel
            stationery, as well as its status as evidence of one’s travels, may have been
            appealing to a new traveler like Stephens, especially as she wrote to family members
            back home who had probably not visited these locales. For McIntyre,
            accessibility while on board ships and cost were possibly two reasons that he would
            sometimes choose to use Alaska Steamship Company stationery, rather than more
            conventional note paper.</p>
         
         <p><strong>Natural vs. Artistic Style in Letter Writing</strong>. Many composition manuals and etiquette guides of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
            centuries
            portray correspondence as a social practice with very defined rules, a practice that
            would reveal the 
            character and training of the letter-writer. For example, Kingsland writes in her
            1903 <cite>Book of Good Manners</cite>, 
            “A letter tells more than the news it contains or the sentiment it expresses, – it
            is a revelation of the 
            character and culture of the writer, and although the matter depends upon mental and
            moral qualities, 
            the manner may be acquired by any one” (375). The letters in this 
            collection, when read alongside instructions for polite and appropriate social correspondence,
            seem to 
            go against many of the accepted standards. For example, Stephens, who writes about
            contracting head lice in 
            Mexico and points out many of the faults of Adelaide’s fiancé, seems to be ignoring
            Kingsland’s directive against 
            writing about unpleasant things since “A letter carries with it an atmosphere, and
            the mood of the writer is contagious. 
            Write kindly of every one” (389). Stephens’ constant stream of gossip, while not necessarily 
            unkind, might not be considered completely appropriate. McIntyre, on the other hand,
            has not fully attended to advice 
            about using correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling: “The character of the one
            addressed should be considered, and 
            the contents of the letter adapted to his tastes and temperament.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mistakes in
            language or little 
            slips in the use of a verb, which may be overlooked in speaking, offend all our sensibilities
            when written” (Kingsland 388). 
            McIntyre has many “little slips” and often adopts flirtatious baby talk—e.g., “fink”
            for "think."</p>
         
         <p>While these letters at times appear to defy standards, they may exemplify other aspects
            of advice to writers, which 
            often appeared alongside the admonitions cited above. For example, Kingsland warns,
            “Do not 
            be hampered by conventionality. Listen to your own thoughts and express them, even
            if they seem crude” (387). 
            And immediately after stating that errors “offend all our sensibilities,” she adds
            that “The recipient of a letter is by
            courtesy bound to suspend all criticism – he must not even think deprecatingly of
            a letter received. 
            Many hesitate to write, fearing criticism” (388). McIntyre does not seem 
            to have feared such criticism from Stephens, and Stephens seems to feel free to express
            her thoughts openly, 
            at least when writing to her mother.</p>
         
         <p>This contradiction in the advice about letter-writing has been pointed out by Schultz:
            “Toward the end of the century, 
            a number of writers recognised that the rules for letter writing they offered were
            ‘custom’, not transcendent. But I see 
            no writers who recognised that their claim that letters should be ‘simple, natural,
            and easy’ – descriptive terms that 
            appear over and over in chapters on letter-writing – were elaborate masks for very
            complex and artificial constructions or 
            that an elaborate irony was embedded in that instruction” (121). White’s 
            <cite>Twentieth Century Etiquette</cite> clearly demonstrates this contradiction: “Write as you would talk were 
            your correspondent present. Try and think over what you intend writing, and say it
            in the most natural way you can. This is 
            the highest art – to do everything in so artistic and finished a manner, that it will
            have the appearance of being a second 
            nature” (234). In writing these letters, Stephens and McIntyre seem to be 
            following the first part of this advice, to view writing as a conversation, while
            sometimes disregarding the need for letters 
            to be “artistic and finished.” McIntyre’s long, rambling sentences with little to
            no punctuation, and Stephens’ string of gossip 
            about neighbors and friends, resemble a conversation more than they do the polished
            model letters that appear in etiquette texts of the time.</p>
         
         <p>The main reason given by most manuals for taking care in writing letters was the potential
            longevity  of the manuscript. Kingsland advises, 
            “Never write anything over your signature of which you might later be ashamed. Our
            letters are often longer-lived than ourselves, and may eventually 
            be read by eyes not yet open to the light” (388). Wells gives an even stronger warning: “beware, and be even over-cautions, 
            rather than not cautious enough, for a letter may serve as a sure witness in cases
            where you might never suppose it could be used. It may live and bear testimony for
            
            years – it does not change with time or circumstance – it is a warrantee deed of whose
            responsibility you can never be free” (194-195). 
            These warnings, at least in the case of the Stephens family letters, were somewhat
            justified in that these letters are still being read, and now transferred 
            into digital format, over one hundred years after they were written. However, Stephens’
            letters to her family are perhaps more 
            interesting to readers today in that they express her feelings and details of her
            daily life honestly, without ornamentation or censoring.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Travel and The Familial Letter</strong>. For the Stephens family,
            letter-writing was essential for staying in touch with far-flung family and friends,
            particularly for Gladys as she traveled across the United States to places that
            would not have been accessible to travelers before the nineteenth century. Schultz
            explicitly connects such travels to changes in the postal system: “Both cause and
            effect of this increased accessibility [to letter writing] was that the need for
            long-distance communication was increasing. As the Westward expansion continued, and
            as the Midwest and South became more populated, the personal correspondence of many
            US residents increased” (111). While the
            increased ease and comfort of travel allowed for greater distances between people,
            personal correspondence maintained close ties between family members: “Throughout
            the nineteenth century, migration across the North American continent compelled many
            people to become letter writers, challenging them to image the genuinely vast
            physical distances traveled and to affirm – through a space and time that
            annihilated fellow travelers – connection with those they hoped their letters would
            reach” (Decker 88). By sharing items of gossip,
            day-to-day events, and descriptions of people and places with her parents and
            others, Stephens created a sense of home even while far away.</p>
         
         <p>Especially following the
            debilitating effects of the American Civil War, the nation turned to the familial
            unit to heal. As rhetorical historian Nan Johnson writes, “the celebration of the
            American home and its promise for salvation for the nation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. its potential to
            heal
            ‘disasters’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [were demonstrated] by courting a nostalgia for
            domesticity” (Johnson 90). Though Stephens writes
            to her mother and father more than forty years after the war has ended, the
            importance of the familial unit had not lost its hold. With the increasing problem
            of alcoholism and intemperance as argued by the Anti-Saloon League, Prohibition
            Party, and Women’s Christian Temperance movement, the maintenance of a close family
            was of dire importance. When a family member like Stephens left home, it was of keen
            importance, therefore, to maintain a sense of family through letter writing. Richard
            A. Wells argues in his 1894 <cite>Manners, Culture and Dress of the Best
               American Society</cite>, “Family correspondence is a great social privilege as
            well as a great necessity. It brings together divided members of the household, and,
            for the while, gives home a place in their hearts. Women always write these best.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
            (Wells 183). Serving this purpose of
            familial transport, the drives for clarity, perspicuity, and, above all, simplicity
            represented in these manuals takes on a new tenor—one should sound like oneself and
            “avoid all ‘stereotyped and stilted language’” in order to follow the oft repeated
            adage that letter writing was “simply to converse on paper, instead of by word of
            mouth” (Sheldon 27; Wells
            182). Thus, while antibellum letter manuals suggest more formal
            address between child and parent, post-bellum manuals argue for the less formal, more
            casual style we see in Stephens’ letters home.</p>
         
         <p>Though Stephens might have been able to phone home when she was closer to Newton,
            
            for those used to writing letters, the telephone seemed too casual—“A note 
            of invitation requires answer by post; such a missive should not be dismissed by 
            telephone or telegraphic"—or too formal—“why the telephone which seems 
            more intimate [is] in reality more formal? We say something just to say something
            &amp; 
            yet underneath are striving” (Roberts 473; Rothman 224). 
            One also had to take care of what was said over the telephone for fear the operator
            
            was listening in. And, yet, letter writing manuals also cautioned that one should
            not 
            write anything that one didn’t want a third party to read, for letters, especially
            letters 
            home, were often read aloud among family members. It is interesting, then, that Stephens
            pens 
            several relatively uncouth and gossipy statements (by the manuals’ standards, at least)
            to 
            her mother regarding the monetary situations of those she meets, her weight, her sunburn,
            etc.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>The Love Letter</strong>. <cite>Chesterfield’s Art of
               Letter-Writing Simplified</cite> (1857) warns “Always compose your love-letters
            in a style that you would not be ashamed to have them fall into the hands of a third
            party” (57). Sheldon adds, arguing for the
            natural style mentioned above, that overly-florid language won’t help anyway because
            “no wise woman’s heart is won by silly flattery. On the contrary, insipid
            compliments tend only to disgust her” (55). And
            yet, Sheldon also warns men, “Be not too humble in your utterances, as great
            humility borders closely upon servility, and no right-minded woman desires a slave
            for a husband” (56). As this last line
            suggests, the love letter and love-letter manuals are rich places to explore gender
            relations of the early 1900s.</p>
         
         <p>For instance, in McIntyre’s
            letters to Stephens (we have no letters of hers to him) he often tells
            her that she makes him “determined to do better” (10.11.09). As Ellen K. Rothman
            explains in her <cite>Hands and Hearts: A History of Courtship in
               America</cite>, women were thought to have morally purifying powers upon men who
            were “impelled by ‘animal instincts’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Women could—indeed,
            must—help men in the struggle for self-control” (186). One love letter Rothman quotes sounds very similar to
            McIntyre’s: “You are my good influence to keep me pure in
            heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your influence makes me more manly” (187). Yet
            as Rothman and Johnson argue, “the doctrine of female influence had long served to
            justify the subordination of woman: she did not need the vote since her innate
            superiority gave her so much influence” (Rothman
            189). Because women were seen as the paradigm of self-control and
            lodestones of morality, “The late nineteenth-century view was that
            women, although more emotional and sensitive than men, loved less intensely”
            (Rothman 200). Thus, beyond Stephens simply not
            sharing McIntrye’s feelings, this learned repression might be one reason that
            McIntyre asks, “I wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being
            of quite a different desposition [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of
            mind and you not so much so” (8.20.09). This feminine temperance and control might
            also be an explanation for the little tests of love McIntyre seems to set up: for
            instance, he asks “I wonder what influence it would have on you to have some one put
            up an [argument?] against me” (9.11.09). He also, seemingly to stir up Stephens’
            passions, is not above mentioning that the purser's sister one trip "is quite a little
            flirt" (letter of 10.4.09).</p>
         
         <p>The role of the ideal woman
            was to resist and purify (sometimes to the point of being defined as “rhetorically
            meek”), and the role of the ideal man was to balance wooing and being purified
            (Johnson 48). Within his wooing, however,
            the manuals suggest that a man still needs to maintain his manliness through
            avoiding “all exaggeration of statement and profusion of endearing epithets which
            characterizes morbid sentiment and makes one appear ridiculous” (Sheldon 56). McIntyre clearly does not heed this
            advice, consistently using his favorite epithet “Little Girl” to refer to Stephens.
            But Rothman suggests that this advice was typically not heeded, stating that,
            “‘little girl’ was not unusual. Beginning around 1880, couples began to use ‘little
            girl’ and ‘little boy’ as terms of endearment. It seems logical that men and women
            raised in the increasingly child-centered, emotionally dependent families
            characteristic of late Victorian middle classes would associate intimacy with the
            parent-child relationship and feel comfortable addressing each other by a term that
            evoked the closeness and dependency of childhood” (Rothman
            206).</p>

         <p><strong>Railroads and The Promotion of Tourism in the American West</strong>.
            Gladys Stevens's letters in this collection, documenting both the ordinary and
            extraordinary details of her various excursions, prompt readers to make inquiries
            of
            different kinds about the nature of tourism in the first decade of the twentieth
            century. On one hand, we wonder about Stephens the person: what were her reasons for
            taking an extended trip into the Pacific Northwest, how did she as a young single
            woman have the means to do so, and who were her fellow travelers? On the other hand,
            Stephens’s letters inspire a curiosity about the place itself: how would a
            traveler—any traveler—have imagined the Pacific Northwest in 1909? Given the
            centrality of the American west to the ethos of American exceptionalism, and the
            powerful myths of the frontier that shaped American thought so profoundly throughout
            the nineteenth century, what cultural and political forces would have been at work
            in 1909 to shape a tourist’s experience of an increasingly modernized frontier?</p>
         
         <p>It seems important at this point to give a brief account of the ways that people
            experienced greater mobility in a new region— the ways that the west became more
            accessible physically to new groups of tourists in Stephens’s time. Perhaps the most
            important railroad presence in the region, The Union Pacific Railroad would connect
            the essentially "foreign" country of the Pacific Northwest to the well-developed
            urban east. United with the Central Pacific line in Utah in 1869, the Union Pacific
            Railroad not only achieved the distinction of becoming the first transcontinental
            railroad in the United States, but heralded itself as a symbol of national
            unification and patriotic spirit in tense post-war years. Thwarted by the tough
            terrain of the Rocky Mountains, sectional tensions among its converging routes, and
            attacks from the Native American tribes who were displaced by railroad construction,
            the process toward completion was arduous. However, the Union Pacific ultimately
            made it possible to travel from New York City to San Francisco in only ten days. By
            the final years of the nineteenth century, it had become not only a vehicle for
            freight, but for people, and a new era of tourism began in the American west. When
            the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy in 1897, railroad baron E.H. Harriman purchased
            the company, and in 1901 he initiated a series of aggressive infrastructural
            improvements to the Overland Route, the principal passenger train line. With
            hundreds of new miles of double track and shortened routes, the Union Pacific was
            restored to prominence and profitability. Although Stephens does not explicitly
            mention that she traveled west by rail, it is a reasonable assumption; a
            cross-country trip in an automobile would have been unlikely (and daring) in 1909.
            As we try to imagine the world in which Stephens lived and the means by which she
            moved through it, these climactic years for the railroad industry offer a compelling
            context in which to place her. She was traveling in the West at a time when people
            could travel vast distances with speed, safety, and perhaps for the first time ever,
            in comfort ("Historical Overview").</p>
         
         <p>However, of equal importance is the way that the West was opened imaginatively to
            tourists at the turn of the century. The very railroad companies that made it
            possible for new groups of Americans to see the West for themselves also played an
            incredibly prominent role in the perpetuation of a certain image of the American
            West. Of principal interest are the See America First campaign launched by civic
            leaders in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wonderland series issued by the Northern
            Pacific Railroad from 1883 to 1906 (Schwantes 27). The "See
            America First" advertising campaign began simply as a slogan created by Fisher
            Sanford Harris, a passionate community advocate and local politician in Salt Lake
            City. Eventually, his slogan became the most recognizable creed of the national
            parks in America. Citizens interested in developing a thriving tourist industry in
            the West “used See America First not simply as a booster slogan to promote the idea
            of a cooperative tourist organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but more broadly as an
            expression of western regionalism in response to the centralizing forces that were
            reconfiguring the emerging urban industrial nation-state” (Shaffer 560). “See America First” went from being a headline in the
            Salt Lake Telegram in 1905, to the proper designation for a league of delegates and
            fundraisers devoted to promoting tourism in the West, and eventually could be found
            on every billboard advertising the Great Northern Railway.</p>
         
         <p>See America First was intimately connected to the spirit of American
            exceptionalism. “Nationalist Americans,” Marguerite Shaffer writes, “looked to the
            American landscape with its abundant national resources and magnificent scenery to
            compensate for America’s lack of an ancient past. Scenic and sublime wilderness in
            America offered a natural legacy representative of American .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
            superiority over Europe” (565). Harris’s
            brainchild was originally conceived as a means of interesting American middle-class
            and upper-class citizens in domestic travel; countless American dollars were being
            spent by an emergent leisure class on sightseeing in Europe, and westerners believed
            that the American frontier was the answer to the problem. In similar fashion, and
            perhaps broader in cultural scope, was the Northern Pacific Railroad’s “Wonderland”
            series. Borrowing from the title of Lewis Carroll’s popular book, the Northern
            Pacific Railroad Company issued a volume each year between 1883 and 1906 that
            featured various attractions of the Pacific Northwest. Some of the issues were
            devoted specifically to different Pacific Northwest localities, like Yellowstone
            Park or the Inland Passage in Alaska. Others treated the region traversed by the
            railroad as a whole. The booklets included propagandistic descriptions of the
            landscape and vivid illustrations designed to lure travelers to ride its
            rails (n.p.). It is difficult to imagine
            that, somewhere along her journey, Stephens would not have seen one of the See America
            First billboards, or that she grew up in a literate middle-class family without ever
            leafing through one of the Wonderland books that would have certainly captured the
            imagination of an independent young woman.</p>
         
         <p>Also important to our understanding of Stephens’s cultural perspective, with respect
            to the presence of railroads, is our understanding of the effect they had on
            defining a region. Because of railroads, the Pacific Northwest became the next
            entrepreneurial endeavor of America’s modern economy. However, John M. Findlay notes
            that “the railroad companies’ efforts to create a distinct regional identity may
            have counted for more. To be profitable in the Northwest, they needed to attract
            [people] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to ride their trains .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the companies launched
            continual publicity campaigns to sell Oregon, Idaho, and Washington as a single
            region called ‘the Great Northwest’” (Shaffer 51).
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 and Destination Travel
               to Yellowstone Park</strong>. Like many World's Fair expositions at the turn of the
            century, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 (AYP) was a destination to
            which many people would travel vast distances. As mentioned above, Stephens
            (originally from Massachusetts) likely travelled west to the AYP Exposition by rail.
            Stephens’s visit to Yellowstone Park en route to the fair suggests that she rode the
            Northern Pacific Railroad, which actively advertised its sleeper car service from
            St. Louis to Yellowstone as an en-route destination to the AYP Exposition. Visitors
            could lay over at Yellowstone Park as part of a Seattle-bound itinerary for no
            additional charge from the Northern Pacific railroad. During their visit to
            Yellowstone, an elaborate set of stagecoach routes and resort-style hotels ensured
            that well-off visitors could spend days sightseeing the park in comfort and style
            ("The Northern Pacific
            Railway's Wonderland" 37-40). Thus, in her travels to the
            AYP Exposition, Stephens traveled through an idealized American West that was largely
            constructed by the emergent tourist industry; the version of Yellowstone Park that
            she encounters is almost as intricately engineered and maintained as the AYP
            Exposition itself. </p>
         
         <p> Although the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (AYP) Exposition of 1909 was particularly
            focused on promoting commerce and tourism in the Pacific Northwest, it can and
            should be contextualized in terms of a larger Exposition culture in America and
            around the world. The fair takes place 58 years after the first such event, The
            Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London in 1851, and 56 years after the first American
            Exposition held in New York City in 1853. Like many American expositions, the AYP
            was originally conceived as a commemoration of an American historical event. The
            1876 Centennial Exposition commemorated the Declaration of Independence; the Chicago
            World’s Fair commemorated the arrival of Columbus in America; the 1904 St. Louis
            Exposition commemorated the Louisiana Purchase; and the 1905 Portland Exposition
            commemorated the westward journey of Lewis and Clark ("Northern Pacific"
            6). Indeed, this larger exposition culture ultimately affected the
            AYP’s reimagining from a 1907 celebration of the 1897 Klondike Gold Rush to a 1909
            celebration of Pacific Northwest commerce and tourism; the AYP Exposition was moved
            from 1907 to 1909 partly to avoid conflict with the 1907 World’s Fair in Norfolk,
            Virginia that commemorated the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown
            Settlement ("Northern
            Pacific" 9).
            </p>
         
         <p>
            As a Northern Pacific Railroad brochure advertising the AYP shows, the exposition
            ultimately downplayed its 
            relationship to the Klondike Gold Rush:
            <br><div class="blockquote">
               The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition is based upon no historical incident.  
               It is simply and frankly a broad, commercial proposition, but it will be 
               just as full and complete, just as educative and valuable and satisfying 
               as if it commemorated the most profoundly impressive event in our national
               history. ("Northern
               Pacific" 6)
               <br></div>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Whether Stephens had been to any other World’s Fair expositions is unknown, but Stephens
            suggests in her 
            letters that at least some of her upper-class travel companions have been to other
            expositions.  
            Nonetheless, with an estimated attendance of 3.7 million people, the AYP Exposition
            undoubtedly attracted 
            a range of visitors from many walks of life and socioeconomic classes.  Advertisements
            for the exposition 
            corroborate this range of attendees: for example, a 1909 Northern Pacific Railroad
            pamphlet reminds readers 
            that they can contact the Exposition’s travel bureau by mail regarding the size of
            their travel party and 
            their budget, and in exchange, the travel bureau will “return a list of addresses
            of the class of 
            accommodations required” ("Northern
            Pacific" 27).
            </p>
         
         <p>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition was constructed on 250 acres on the grounds of
            the University of 
            Washington and was located an approximately 20-minute ride by streetcar from downtown
            Seattle.  
            The University of Washington had struggled to expand at the same rate as Seattle’s
            fast-growing population, 
            and although many of the AYP buildings were designed to be temporary, the University
            of Washington claimed 
            and used many AYP buildings after the fair’s conclusion.  Most of the elaborate landscaping
            originally designed by John Olmsted has been built over in the subsequent century,
            
            but the University of Washington campus continues to bear the overall layout of the
            AYP 
            Exposition grounds.  For example, the main thoroughfare of Rainier Avenue continues
            to bisect the campus and point 
            to the iconic Mount Rainier; each side of the fairgrounds is still bordered by scenic
            man-made lakes (University of Washington, n.p.).
            </p>
         
         <p> In some regards, the AYP Exposition was a typical American World’s Fair: like many
            other such fairs, it had a busy midway (called the “Pay Streak”) that included rides
            such as a roller coaster and ferris wheel, dancing, food, and risqué sideshows. A
            number of travelling exhibits common to other World’s Fairs reappeared at the AYP
            Exposition, including an exhibit of baby incubators for infants born as early as 6
            to 7 months’ gestation; buildings and exhibits financed by other states who wished
            to promote their industries (Pennsylvania, for example, financed a mining exhibit);
            buildings extravagantly designed in a wide range of architectural styles; and
            brilliant electric displays that illuminated the fair until midnight each night
            (University of Washington, n.p.). In other regards, however, the
            AYP was unique among World’s Fair Expositions. The AYP's strong focus on the Pacific
            Northwest region’s commerce and industry influenced many of its exhibits, including
            the Forestry Building that Stephens describes in detail in her letter from July 10th.
            The Northern Pacific Railroad’s promotional pamphlet for the fair states the AYP
            Exposition’s goals:
            <br><div class="blockquote">
               FIRST: To exploit the resources and potentialities of the Alaska and Yukon territories
               in the United States 
               and the Dominion of Canada.
               SECOND: To make known and foster the vast importance of the trade of the Pacific Ocean
               and of the countries 
               bordering thereon.
               THIRD: To demonstrate the marvelous progress of Western America, where, within a radius
               of 1,000 miles of 
               Seattle, 7,500,000 persons live who are directly interested in making the exposition
               the true exponent of 
               their material wealth and development. ("Northern Pacific" 5)
               <br></div> </p>
         
         <p> In accordance with these goals, Washington state’s major Pacific trade
            partner—Japan—had a strong presence at the fair. According to the documentary film
            <cite>Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition: Seattle’s Forgotten World’s
               Fair</cite>, Ships from the Japanese Navy docked at Puget Sound, the Japanese tea
            house was a popular attraction with visitors, and Japanese dignitaries visited the
            fairgrounds. The AYP was also a product of its unique historical moment: for
            example, the AYP was held just six years after the Wright Brothers’ historic first
            flight, and airplanes were thus a popular exhibit item at the fair. The
            controversial win (and subsequent disqualification) of a Ford Model T in the AYP
            Exposition’s New-York-to-Seattle automobile race helped launch the popular Ford
            Model T in the American market (the vehicle made its debut approximately 9 months
            earlier, in September 1908). Women’s suffrage activists from around the country
            converged on AYP Exposition to lobby for women’s right to vote, and perhaps partly
            because of their efforts, Washington State granted women’s suffrage the following
            year. Whereas many previous American Expositions had made most of their money
            selling alcohol, the AYP was a “dry” fair—partly because of its placement on
            the University of Washington Campus, which was dry by law. Nonetheless, the AYP
            turned a profit and was considered a success (Forsen, n.p.).</p>
         
         <p>
            In one of her letters, Stephens mentions a feature of turn-of-the-century Expositions
            that modern readers 
            may find troubling: the display of what Stephens calls 
            "bare natives"
             in exhibits such as the Hawaiian 
            Building, the Igarotte Building, and the Eskimo Building.  Native peoples were often
            displayed at 
            Expositions such as the AYP, sometimes taking the form of side-show-like displays
            in which visitors 
            could view the natives engaged in leisure activities and sometimes in the form of
            active stage shows 
            involving fights, sport displays, or simulated Cowboy-and-Indian battles.  These exhibits
            were explicitly 
            part of a larger Western imperial project and were meant to show visitors that the
            native peoples that 
            the Western powers colonized could benefit from the technological and social progress
            on display elsewhere 
            on the Exposition grounds.  Recent historians, however, have suggested that the relationship
            between
            native peoples and these exhibits is more complex and nuanced than it may at first
            appear: for example, 
            the AYP’s Igarotte Building featured exhibits by the indigenous Igarotte hill people
            from the Phillippines, 
            a troupe that appeared regularly at many World’s Fairs and were financially compensated
            for their 
            performance through a hired business manager.  The AYP Fair Queen was an Inuit girl
            who had grown up 
            appearing in Eskimo exhibits at World’s Fairs; in exchange for financial compensation,
            she and her 
            family would pose for photographs in front of a plastic igloo at the Eskimo Building.
            In other words, 
            some of the native peoples involved with American Exposition culture were consciously
            choosing to put 
            themselves on display for profit, thereby gaining financially and socially from a
            system that aimed to 
            exploit and denigrate them (Forsen, n.p.).

         <p><strong>Seattle, a Rapidly Expanding City</strong>. In 1909 the young Gladys
            Stephens made her way to Seattle as part of a series of destinations visited in
            anticipation of the 1909 World Fair, also known as the Alaska Yukon-Pacific
            Exposition, in Seattle. But what sort of city was Gladys entering? We see in her
            letters mentions of her life in Seattle and all it entailed, but scant detail is
            paid to the city itself, its history, and the peculiar time in which she visited.
            Seattle during this period had grown continuously, backed by the latest and last
            Gold Rush in the United States, the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-1898 described at
            length by Lisa Mighetto and Marcia Montgomery in <cite>Hard Drive to the
               Klondike</cite>. The Klondike Gold Rush was centered in Alaska, however Seattle’s
            position in the extreme northwest of the continental United States, and its port on
            Puget Sound, made it invaluable as a transit point for those moving to Alaska to
            mine, and those returning with or without gold. As a result of the Gold Rush, Seattle
            became a hotbed for a number of industries supporting the influx of males looking
            to
            strike it rich, including a burgeoning saloon industry, illegal gambling
            interests, and businessmen promoting prostitution and later pornography (Berner 5).
            Approximately 100,000 miners were attracted by the Gold Rush, and some 70,000 of
            them passed through Seattle, nearly doubling the previous population of the
            city (Mighetto and Montgomery 17). By the end of the next decade,
            the influx of population and gold had led to a rapid increase in the boundaries of
            the city itself as wide swaths of land to the south of Elliott Bay were annexed as
            well as territory to the extreme north of the city (Schmid). By 1910, the city had grown from a population in 1880 of
            3,533 to 237,194, an increase far exceeding many other American cities during the
            same period ( McDonald 1959).</p>
         
         <p>
            In Seattle Stephens would have found a bevy of men, a boisterous nightlife, and a
            city in the process of 
            transforming itself.  Although Seattle continued to be a coal and wood-burning city
            during this period 
            beautification became a significant priority, leading to the creation of a comprehensive
            park plan for 
            the city, developed by the Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts (Berner 104). The park system 
            developed piecemeal, acquisition of land focusing on tracts with views of the water,
            
            mountains and woodlands.  This park system would have constituted the primary means
            for Stephens 
            to move about the city, as the parks were connected by parkways and boulevards that
            bridle paths for horses 
            and carriages (Berner 105). In addition to movement about the city, Stephens was 
            quite interested in the World’s Fair, and would have been a frequent visitor to the
            Fair on its site 
            amidst the new campus of the University of Washington. The University, originally
            located downtown, had 
            moved to the shore of Lake Washington, just east of Union Bay, in 1894. Its new site
            was on 
            the periphery of the city proper, meaning that construction efforts involved clearing
            forest, supplying 
            utilities and so forth (Berner 82). The Exposition sparked 
            continual increase in the University’s capabilities and reputation as its selection
            as the site of the 
            Exposition in 1906 funneled funds into such departments as forestry, journalism, and
            domestic science 
            during a time when the Washington state legislature resisted financing the continued
            construction at the university 
            (Berner 84-85). In the midst of great economic and social development, Stephens encountered a 
            city as much in the growing stages of its life as she herself was.  Neither fully
            formed, both still 
            vibrant and ever-changing, Seattle proved to be a powerful site motivating frequent
            correspondence with 
            Stephens’s circle of family and acquaintances.

         <p><strong>Shipping and Tourism in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest</strong>.
            The 1895 <cite>Lewis &amp; Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest</cite> reports 
            that 
            "Russia's transfer of Alasksa to the United States in 1867 enlarged the field of marine
            
            operations in the North Pacific"
             (155). The purchase included 
            the Russian steamer <i>Politkofsky</i> (156), 
            foreshadowing the role that steamer vessels were to play in the exploration, colonization,
            
            commercialization, and tourism of the Alaskan frontier. Additionally, the <cite>Marine 
               History</cite> records that "[t]he most important event of [1889] was the
            organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the 
            Puget Sound and Alaska Steamship Company" (363), for which 
            James J. McIntyre sails and works on the <i>Santa Clara</i> and 
            <i>Northwestern</i>, among other ships, in 1909.
            </p>
         
         <p> Within the selected letters presented here, McIntyre never explicitly mentions the
            potential dangers of his work, but the wreck of the <i>S.S.
               Ohio</i> informs some of his remarks about various ships. In his September 13
            letter, he mentions an acquaintance who was the "Chief from the <i>S.S. Ohio</i>." We do not know if McIntyre ever served on the <i>Ohio</i>, but it had just wrecked on a reef off the coast of Alaska
            a few weeks earlier, killing five people ("Wreck of the
            Steamship Ohio" 14). McIntyre himself would have been involved with
            getting some of the surviving passengers to their original destination, had he not
            transferred from the <i>Santa Clara</i> to the <i>Northwestern</i> when he did. His August 13 letter describes the transfer, the
            <i>Ohio</i> wrecked on August 26, and the <i>Santa Clara</i> left port with passengers from the Ohio on August 30
            ("Steamer Portland"). The contemporary
            account even mentions that the <i>Santa Clara's</i> next stop would be in Juneau to pick up
            survivors from another shipwreck, that of the steamer <i>Humboldt</i>. </p>
         
         <p>
            The contemporary article that mentions the <i>Santa Clara</i> also holds interest for a reader of McIntyre's letters because it sheds 
            some light on the activities of the ships on which he served. Before the <i>Santa Clara</i> had been dispatched to help out the 
            survivors of the <i>Ohio</i>, it had been "idle for three months" ("Steamer Portland"). Thus, 
            when McIntyre refers to the <i>Santa Clara</i> as a "mail boat" in his August 13 letter, we can infer that it was not actively engaged
            
            in shipping mail when he wrote the letter. The <i>Santa Clara</i> may have had a contract with the Post Office at the time, but its idleness 
            helps explain why McIntyre ends that same letter with the word "lightboat." If the
            <i>Santa Clara</i> were serving as a lightboat, or lightship, 
            during those months of inactivity, then it was helping to keep the coast safe by operating
            as a kind of lighthouse upon the water. 
            Such an operation must have been subsidized by the government, but it begs questions
            about how much money the crew and the steamship company 
            made for such services. These circumstances also highlight the numerous purposes of
            the merchant marine during this time. The state of U. S. 
            shipping required steamship companies to come up with various and wide-ranging modes
            of income. 
            </p>
         
         <p>
            McIntyre indicates that his ships are involved in the freight business, especially
            with the rapidly 
            expanding canning and salmon industries. In <cite>The American Year Book</cite> of 
            1910, Emory R. Johnson and G. G. Huebner explain that 
            "[t]he American merchant marine engaged 
            in the coastwise and inland trade trade has increased for many years, while that engaged
            in the 
            foreign trade has gradually declined."
             However, the Atlantic and Gulf region saw more than three times 
            the steam vessels than the Pacific coast, and steam vessels in the Northern lakes
            region 
            carried approximately 63% more freight tonnage than those on the Pacific coast (522). 
            Furthermore, between 1908 and 1909 the number and tonnage of ships constructed on
            the Pacific coast decreased 
            by 23% and 60%, respectively (524). 
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Beyond commerce, the steam vessels in the Pacific Northwest also carried tourists
            to Alaskan destinations. 
            <cite>A Trip to Wonderful Alaska</cite>, a promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship 
            Company, boasts that 
            "the cruise along the Southeastern coast of Alaska is by far the more picturesque"
             
            than 
            "the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence,"
             and that 
            "the voyage to the North is more instructive 
            than a tour of the Old World and the scenery which the tourist beholds surpasses the
            Alps of Switzerland 
            in its mighty and rugged grandeur."
             McIntyre hikes to the lower and upper waterfalls of the Ketchikan 
            River with Irene Palmer, the sister of the <i>Northwestern</i>'s purser, and Gladys 
            Stephens, and he writes to Gladys of the forthcoming totem park at Klawock. Alaskan
            Indian culture was quickly 
            becoming a featured tourist attraction, driven by a perceived enervation of traditional
            cultures and the 
            preservation efforts to counteract that enervation which, ironically, was a product
            of American intrusion. 
            </p>
         
         <p><strong>Salmon and Resource Economies in Alaska</strong>.
            James McIntyre's letter on Sep. 13, 1909, details the cargo carried on the Black Ball
            Line 
            from Alaska to the lower 48 states. In that freight are 126 head of cattle and 3 mules,
            which at first appears to be  necessary livestock for the establishment of settlements
            in Alaska.
            Interestingly, this freight is onboard at the same time as 3000 cases of salmon. The
            former 
            seem to be supplies brought northward from the lower 48 to service the Alaskan outposts,
            the latter seem
            to be freight brought southward to bring the frontier's bounty back to serve a growing
            nation.
            In fact, McIntyre's described trajectory from Ketchikan to Taku and onward to Chilkoot,
            Gypsum, Sitka, and 
            Belling Run is a loop that moves generally southward on the second leg. So, at times,
            the ship 
            would normally have freight for both the northern and southern ends.
            </p>
         
         <p> All of this is to indicate the intensive co-dependent relationship of northern and
            southern markets. Rene De La Pedraja writes that the northern and southern ends of
            the Alaska route were conventionally divided by two local monopolies: the Alaska
            Steamship Company and the Alaska Coast Company (10). But in 1914, after the time of these letters, the Alaska Coast
            Company became the Admiral Line, which was destroyed in 1933 by competition with the
            Alaska Steamship Company (11). Traditionally,
            The Alaska Steamship Company had intruded into the Alaska Coast Company's territory
            when the latter's ships were idle due to the seasonal nature of Alaskan shipping.
            Pacific-borne freight in the early 20th century often suffered from a trade
            imbalance. De La Pedraja notes that the Dollar shipping company resolved its freight
            imbalance by shipping Chinese passengers in freight and skirting the law by flying
            the British flag (175). After having dominated
            Alaska-based freight, the Alaska Shipping Company handled 85% of south-bound
            cargoes, imposing high prices on its primary customers, salmon canneries (11).</p>
         
         <p> This anecdote indicates the troubled relationship between the law and traffic from
            the lower 48 to Alaska. At the height of the Progressive Era, the Federal Government
            struggled with regulating inter-territorial commerce and its now-threatened natural
            resources. Since the beginning of salmon fishing in Alaska, the fishing industry
            recognized the threat of depletion. The obvious solution to this problem at the time
            was to found salmon hatcheries, which were first developed in 1763 in Germany and
            first practiced in the United States in 1866 (Roppel
            3). But hatcheries and canneries had to deal quickly with continued
            ecological collapse. Because fishing continued to deplete salmon runs at the same
            time that hatcheries were running, these two methods were viewed as complements
            rather than supplements: Patricia Roppel describes their attitude, 
            "Why stop
            fishing when a hatchery would in theory replenish the runs?"
            
            (5-6). Over time, the multiple bodies
            involved—fisheries, hatchers, canners, and politicians—all proposed different
            solutions to depletion. As of the 1900 revision of the 1899 fisheries act, all
            persons removing salmon from Alaskan waters were required to establish a hatchery
            that produced at least four sockeye fry, which are today called sac-fry or alevin,
            for every salmon removed (9). Unfortunately,
            because the cannery buildings were 
            "often on sites where water was of poor uqality
            and quantity, where insufficient numbers of salmon returned to provide eggs for
            incubation, or where high water destroyed the structures,"
            
            the law became even more convoluted (9). After a
            1902 bill on salmon culture, the US federal government took possession of all water
            and fish in Alaskan streams, extending 4 miles into the tidewater: the Treasury
            leased the product of the home stream to fishermen, while natives were allowed to
            fish for food, not commerce, from the streams (12). But this policy was overturned in 1906 by a bill that
            superseded the act of 1899 and instead provided a tax-and-rebate system to promote
            private hatcheries. All salmon canned in Alaska were levied four cents a case, while
            hatcheries received a rebate of forty cents for every ten cases of salmon fry
            released (15). The combined effect of this policy was
            that salmon companies would incur levies only by an estimation error—that is, if
            they managed to miscalculate how many salmon they would catch and produce. The
            Alaska Packers Association in 1907 canned 806,808 cases of salmon but paid only 32
            cents in taxes, which they paid with stamps. </p>
         
         <p> Clearly, by the time that James McIntyre loaded 3000 cases of salmon onto the
            Black Ball Line, salmon was a colonial enterprise dedicated to extracting the
            maximum of resources from the Alaskan territory for the longest possible time.
            Assuming that the people who removed 3000 cases of salmon from Alaska had not offset
            their levies with rebates, the cases on McIntyre's boat were taxed only $120, or
            about $2,744 in 2014 (CPI Inflation
            Calculator). The ghostly presence of native fisheries in Congressional
            law is the exemption that proves the rule: the government of the colonialists only
            feels the need to make passing reference to the original fisheries. It goes without
            saying that Roppel's book contains no mention of compensation or reparation, and the
            index doesn't even make any mention of natives or Indians. McIntyre's perspective
            is predicated on the US imperial naval position in the
            early 20th century. In his letter of September 13, he references China, Japan,
            and Manila, all of which had some kind of colonial relationship with the US—under
            the Treaty of Paris (1898), the United States purchased the Philippines from Spain.</p>
         
         <p><strong>The Decline of the U.S. Merchant Marine at the Turn of the
               Century</strong>. Contemporary sources trace the decline of the merchant marine back to the American
            Civel War and its aftermath. 
            In an issue of <cite>The American Marine Engineer</cite> from 1915, an article titled 
            "The American Merchant Marine" quotes secretary McCulloch to 
            help explain the waning U. S. shipping industry (despite the fact that McCulloch 
            served under President Lincoln, and the last time he had held that position was 1885).
            
            According to the anonymously written article, McCulloch blamed various domestic policies
            
            as well as tariffs for status of U. S. shipping: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">The decline of American shipping commenced with the substitution of iron for wooden

               ships, made them too costly to invite 
               capital in that direction and forced it into manufactures.<br></div>
            </p>
         
         <p>These conditions directly and indirectly resulted from the Civil War, and they
            continued to plage the merchant marine for half a century. The article goes on to
            explain that in 1850, 75% of maritime shipping in the U. S. was done by American
            ships, but by 1864, the figure plummeted to 27%. By 1896, it was down to 11%, and
            by
            1914, it reached a low of 8.6% ("The American Merchant
            Marine"). The impact of World War I on European shipping allowed
            for a resurgence in the U. S. merchant marine; however, in 1909 the industry had
            reached an unprecedented low point. </p>
         
         <p>Congress attempted to mitigate the decline of the merchant marine with the passage
            of the Ocean Mail Act of 1891, otherwise known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1891.
            
            Congress had already taken previous actions to subsidize individual steamship companies;
            however, as Rene De La Pedraja notes, 
            this was "the first general subsidy bill passed by Congress since the pre-Civil War
            period" (452). The act 
            positioned the Post Office to consider bids and renewals for five- and ten-year contracts,
            which, as De La Pedraja observes, 
            "halted but did not reverse the downward trend in the U.S. merchant marine" (452). Ships built in the United States were quite 
            expensive at the time, so the act only benefitted the larger, more established steamship
            companies. Also, the subsidies 
            themselves were apparently only moderately enticing—of the fifty-three mail routes
            that the Post Office sought bids for, 
            they received only eleven proposals (De La Pedraja 452). Nonetheless, by the turn of the century, private companies in the 
            merchant marine were shipping mail across both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Thus,
            when McIntyre refers to the 
            <i>Santa Clara</i> as a "mail boat" in his letter of August 13, he underscores one of the primary functions
            of the merchant marine 
            at the time.

         <p><strong>Social Status of Maritime Workers</strong>. Of interest to diverse
            readers will be the curious love affair between James J. McIntyre and Gladys
            Stephens. In fact, upon reading McIntyre's letters, one must wonder how James
            McIntyre, a crewmember on the <i>S.S. Northwestern</i> and Gladys
            Stephens, a lady of some means and social mobility, could ever have met and fallen
            in love. McIntyre’s correspondence with Stephens does not provide much information
            regarding how the two met or indeed, how their very different lives ever crossed
            paths. Given that they both seem to have been in Seattle Seattle at the same time, it is probable that
            Stephens and McIntyre met there or onboard one of the ships on which McIntyre
            served. correspondence. However they met, at the center of their
            romance is a budding intrigue—McIntyre often mentions his concern that Stephens’s
            family will disapprove of him and of their relationship. The man is clearly
            conscious of a great disparity in their social stations and thus an overwhelming
            sense of his own inadequacy preoccupies McIntyre's letters. McIntyre worries that
            he will be perceived as a man of low class and that he
            will be judged harshly according to contemporary stereotypes about sailors. Indeed,
            in his August 23rd, 1909 letter to Stephens, he attempts to prepare his love for the
            harsh judgments that she may face: 
            <br><div class="blockquote">one off [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] the many things that

            </p>
         
         <p>
            McIntyre’s explanation of the distinctions among the different types of ship crewmen
            provides us with a fascinating window 
            into both the man’s concept of himself and also the complex social strata for laborers
            on merchant ships. Indeed, Anglo-American 
            historians have often advanced the notion that social relations on ships were harmonious
            in spite of differences in rank and file 
            among the ship's crew. However, around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
            social 
            stratification among the different workers was evident. In fact, the workforce of
            the steamship now consisted of three different 
            crews, which were the sailors on deck, the firemen below stoking the steam boilers,
            and in the passenger lines, the stewards in the 
            catering and housekeeping sectors ("A Maritime Race" 178). Since McIntyre was most likely a tramp engineer 
            (a form of unsteady employment that required few skills, and was poorly paid), he
            probably would have belonged to the stoking crew, 
            which was widely regarded as the lowest rank of unskilled labor (179). This crew and all 
            other nontraditional forms of steamship employment in the early 1900s suffered significant
            disparagement from the sailors on deck, who 
            considered themselves as the only true sailors left. McIntyre's desire to differentiate
            himself from other sailors and their bad reputations 
            is interesting from a critical perspective. It may indicate the man's sensitivity
            regarding his low station on the ship and his desire to elevate himself 
            above other crewmembers that likely discriminate against him. 
            
            </p>
         
         <p> His desire to set himself apart from other seafaring men suggests that McIntyre is
            attempting to carve an identity for himself apart from his profession — or at the
            very least, that he is trying to convince Stephens that he is different from other
            men in his position. In his attempt to distance himself from the lot, however,
            McIntyre more often follows expected behaviors for sailors in the late nineteenth
            and early twentieth centuries. David Cordingly reminds us that writing homesick
            letters to their wives and girlfriends was a typical activity for men working on
            merchant ships. As he remarks, 
            "sailors spent, and no doubt still do spend, a
            great deal of time thinking of women .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and above all they wrote letters to
            their women. These letters are often heartrending to read and show that the
            happy-go-lucky sailor was often desperately homesick and wanted nothing more than
            for the voyage to end so he could return to his loved ones at home"
            
            (Cordingly xiii). Perhaps unfortunately
            for McIntyre, his expressions of love and desire for Stephens may have
            come across as mere "sailor talk" to his best girl at home. </p>
         
         <p> While McIntyre’s anxiety may reflect his own insecurity rather than broader social
            attitudes, the surviving letters in this collection lend some support to his
            concern. In his August 23rd letter, McIntyre asks whether Stephens has told her
            mother about their relationship. Interestingly, while Stephens reports in these
            letters about her correspondence with several friends and relatives while on her
            travels in the summer of 1909, she never mentions McIntyre. Of course, we do not have
            her
            letters to McIntyre, but the apprehension that he sometimes betrays in his writing
            is certainly
            understandable: numerous contemporary sources describe the unfavorable reputation
            of
            sailors and other ship crewmen, characterizing them as swarthy, crass,
            uneducated and unfaithful. In fact, by the early nineteenth century, the warning
            that 
            "a sailor has a wife in every port"
             was a well-worn saying (<cite>Seafaring Women</cite> xiii).
            Stephens is likely aware of these stereotypes about sailors, and her apparent silence
            may be an indication of her hesitation to pursue
            the relationship. Nonetheless, the letters from James McIntyre to Gladys Stephens
            provide a fascinating glimpse into what might have once been a steamy love affair
            between two individuals of highly different social stations—one likely to
            raise a few eyebrows. </p>
         
         <p><strong>The Tramp Engineer</strong>.
            It is probable that McIntyre was a tramp engineer, a low-skill worker with little
            or no formal training 
            who moves from job to job and company to company with little warning or loyalty. In
            his letter of 
            04 October 1909, he indicates that he has been a tramp engineer on five different
            ships that year. 
            Understandably, the tramp engineer drew criticism in the same way that low-skilled
            
            workers still do, but tramp engineers also had their champions. In the July 1907 issue
            of <cite>The American 
               Marine Engineer</cite>, a pseduonymous author declares that 
            "it's the tramp experience 
            that teaches a man to do impossible things. It's the tramp engineer, a thousand miles
            from port, with a 
            monkey wrench, a cold chisel, a file, and a ratched brace that rebores a cylinder,
            puts in a new furnace 
            or does some other equally impossible stunt that the mail boat engineer would only
            dream of after a 
            welsh rarebit supper"
             (20).
            The itinterant and unprivileged nature of the position, though, were difficult to
            mask with braggadocio, 
            and McIntyre seems to voice discontent when he writes that he has had enough changes
            for one year (04 October 
            1909). On the other hand, McIntyre did not sail internationally and therefore did
            not have to endure 
            the long absences from home that receive a sarcastic send-up in the May 1914 issue
            of <cite>The 
               Sailors' Magazine</cite>: 
            "[d]on't think that I am grumbling; sure not. Why, a little over three years 
            ago I saw my wife, and had the good fortune to be in her company for almost the whole
            of an hour"
             
            (74). Regardless, the job was dangerous, and the tramp engineer 
            would likely be assigned the riskiest manual labor—McIntyre warns that because the
            <i>Northwestern</i>'s 
            boilers have been acting up, it will be 
            "a wonder"
             if no one is seriously injured (04 October 1909).
            </p>              
         
         <p><strong>U.S. Perceptions of Mexico</strong>. Just as tourism between the Mississippi and Pacific shaped and reflected conceptions
            of America and the American 
            west, tourism and travel writing constructed a Mexico that validated a perception
            of the United States as a 
            benevolent, civilizing, superior force. Travelogues such as Mary Blake and Margaret
            Sullivan's 
            <cite>Mexico, Picturesque, Political, Progressive</cite> (1888) and T. Philip Terry's 
            <cite>Terry's Guides to Mexico</cite> (1909) portrayed Mexico and Mexicans as either
            quaint and exotic or dangerous and degenerate. The travelogues frequently used descriptions
            of dress
            to define Mexican identity. Stephens's descriptions of Mexico reflect the topics and
            attitudes of 
            these travelogues. Her observations about Mexican clothing as either exotic costume
            (when she describes the tight 
            pants and large hats of Mexican men) or a mark of uncivilized behavior (as in the
            case of the "peon women" who don't 
            wear corsets and the children who sometimes don't wear clothing) illustrates the fetishizing
            and denigrating 
            catigorization found in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century travelogues.
            Such passages also reflect the 
            inherent attitude of superiority in turn-of-the-century doctrines of Manifest Destiny
            and American expansion.
            </p>
         
         <p>For all that the United States professed a policy of splendid isolation in the late
            nineteenth and early twentieth 
            centuries, the United States government rigorously pursued U.S. economic and political
            interests in Mexico, 
            Central America, and South America, at times supporting revolutionaries and regimes
            materially, financially, and politically. 
            This unofficial policy of political support for the United States' commercial interests
            abroad provided impetus for 
            the 1909 Taft-Díaz meeting in El Paso and La Ciudad Juarez. On October 16, 1909, President
            William Taft of the United 
            States and President Porfirio Díaz of Mexico met to discuss the political and economic
            relationship between the United 
            States and Mexico. Taft was particularly concerned that Diaz would continue his support
            of the United States' economic 
            interests in Mexico, as Mexico's civic unrest threatened to disturb the farms and
            businesses of the United States 
            within Mexico. In 1909, Díaz's position in Mexico was becoming increasingly unstable;
            in 1910, the country erupted in 
            revolution and civil war as multiple factions fought against each other and Diaz's
            government. In her letter to her mother dated 
            September 22, 1909, Gladys Stephens comments on the rising political unrest in Mexico
            and on her excitement 
            about the upcoming meeting between Díaz and Taft. Stephens's presence in El Paso and
            Mexico approximately one month before Taft and Díaz 
            met places her accounts of the political situation in Mexico within the larger context
            of the relationship between the 
            United States and Mexico on the eve of the Mexican Revolution. Her suggestion that
            the Rurales were necessary to keep 
            civic order and her statements that the rising civic unrest reflects fear of Reyes
            taking power rather 
            than dissatisfaction with Díaz's regime mirrors the contemporary attitude of the United
            States towards Presiden Díaz.

            <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
               previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
               and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
               include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries,
               30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia
               Peabody Hawthorne to her

               by Samuel Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal
               of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
            
            
            <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
               on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
               English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
               opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
               cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
               databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
               what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
               represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
               reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
               students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
               us
               about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            
            
            <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
               explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
               the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
               and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
               that shape particular interpretations and presentations texts; and the mediation of
               electronic delivery systems.</p>
            
            
            <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
               need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
               or
               the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
               the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
               Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
               broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
               example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
               historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
               case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
               need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
               archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
               matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
               the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
               original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
               the source texts.</p>
            
            
            <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
               representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
               to
               manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
               a
               variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
            
            
            <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
               the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
               consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
               structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
               repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
               However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
               revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

            brochures. Finally, the collection includes 110 small photographs. The 622 dated
            items in the collection range from 1834 to 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date
            from between 1907
            and 1914, with another 3% from 1917. Ten of the 110 photographs are dated, the dates
            scattered through the years covered by the letters.</p>
         
         <p>Detailed physical and bibliographical descriptions of the

            edition. More general information about the format of the other materials in the

            While the Libraries' finding aid identifies 180 different individual and corporate
            correspondents or
            authors, and 24 different correspondees, Gladys Stephens emerges unquestionably
            as the central figure in the collection: she is listed as the recipient of 334 of
            the letters and 138 of the postcards, and as the author of 54 letters and
            postcards. Given the contraints of our project—especially the length of an academic
            term—we
            decided to work with a subset of the collection that suggests the richness of the
            whole but
            offers something of an epistolary narrative. The letters in the present edition tell
            the story of two young lives
            intersecting during the course of travel and work in the early twentieth-century United
            States of America.
            Gladys Stephens writes eight letters to her mother about her travels west through
            Yosemite National Park
            to visit the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exhibition in Seattle, then south along the
            California coast
            and east along the nation's southwest tier with a stop to visit an uncle in El Paso,
            Texas. At some
            point during her stay in Seattle, she strikes up a relationship with James J. McIntyre,
            a merchant sailor plying the southeastern
            coast of Alaska, who writes six letters to her during the summer and fall recounting
            his
            adventures. Another letter written by Gladys's aunt during that summer shares further
            information
            about Gladys's travels with her mother.

         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Stephens letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
            abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions
            above and below
            the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
            have all been transcribed and encoded as they appear in the original manuscripts.
            The
            representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation
            of 
            the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View"
            link
            at the top of each view's page.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Stephens letters follows The
            Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>,
            as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
            This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from
            the main XML file
            using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were
            encoded in HTML separately.
            A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu,
            and all source files
            (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists
            of people, places, ships, 
            and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main
            XML
            document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate
            appendices provide 
            further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and
            so on). 
            All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
            transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation
            in The Ohio State University's 
            Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor
            Ulman.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response
            to 
            which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in
            the NINES database.

         <p><strong>Adelaide MacPhearson's fiance ("the man")</strong>.
            Gladys Stephens never refers to Adelaide's fiance
            by name, but tells her mother about his income ($50 per week) 
            and drinking habits (
            "the man"
             prefers a good cocktail at his club)
            in her letter postmarked September 24, 1909. He may also be known as 
            
            "the Scotchman."
             In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 23 August 1909, James McIntyre 
            asks about "the Scotchman" and wonders whether this man is 
            "brooke."
             If the
            Scotchman is indeed Adelaide's fiance, this question could be a joke about recent
            
            wedding costs.</p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Cora L.</strong> (b. 1877).
            Cora writes to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, her aunt, on August 19,
            1909, to tell her about the birth of her son. She also inquires about Gladys Stephens's
            travels.</p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Gladys</strong> (b. 1903).
            Gladys Anderson is Cora Anderson's daughter. She's mentioned in Cora's letter to Mrs.
            A. T. Stephens on August 19, 1909.</p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Willis D.</strong> (b. 1876).
            Willis Anderson is Cora Anderson's husband. He's mentioned in her letter to Mrs. A.
            T. Stephens on August 19, 1909.</p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Willis Goodwin</strong> (b. Aug. 4, 1909).
            Willis Goodwin Anderson is Cora Anderson's son, born in August
            of 1909. Cora writes to Mrs. A. T. Stephens on August 19, 1909 to tell her about
            Willis' birth, although his name is not mentioned in the letter..</p>
         <p><strong>Astor, Mrs. Waldorf</strong>.
             In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys Stephens describes travelling
            with a Virginian named Mrs. Hughes who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs.
            Waldorf Astor. "Mrs. Waldorf Astor" likely refers to Nancy Astor, wife of British
            Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, Waldorf Astor. Nancy Astor became the first
            female Member of Parliament when she succeeded her husband as MP for Plymouth Sutton
            in 1919; she served until 1945. Along with her sister, Mrs. Dana Gibson (nee Irene
            Langhorne), Nancy Astor served as inspiration for the iconic Gibson Girl sketches
            penned by her brother in law, Charles Dana Gibson. </p>
         <p><strong>Burns</strong>.
            James McIntyre's letters indicate that McIntyre respects 
            Burns, and McIntyre even quotes him in a letter of 8/23/1909 to Gladys Stephens.</p>
         <p><strong>Campbell, Miss</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys
            Stephens notes that Miss Campbell is still 
            "switching along."
            </p>
         <p><strong>Dotens</strong>.
            In her letter of 8 August 1909, Gladys Stephens mentions corresponding with the Dotens.</p>
         <p><strong>Duff, Mrs</strong>.
            Gladys Stephens notes in her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T.
            Stephens that she sent a card from Mexico to Mrs. Duff.</p>
         <p><strong>Dunne, Alice</strong>.
            Gladys remarks in her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens that Alice would
            have a 
            way of tiring Mrs. Stephens out.</p>
         <p><strong>Díaz, Jose de la Cruz Porfirio</strong>.
            In her letter to her mother postmarked
            September 24, 1909, Gladys discusses the political tension in 
            Mexico due to Pres. Diaz' advanced age and the upcoming election. 
            Gladys spells "Díaz" as "Dias." President Díaz was exiled from 
            Mexico in 1911, not long after the start of the Mexican Revolution 
            in 1910, the year following Gladys's visit.
            </p>
         <p><strong>Florence</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys
            Stephens asks how Florence is 
            "carrying sail."
            </p>
         <p><strong>Gibson, Mrs. Dana</strong>.
             In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys Stephens describes traveling
            with a Virginian named Mrs. Hughes, who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs.
            Waldorf Astor. Mrs. Dana Gibson is likely a reference to Irene Langhorne, originally
            of Danville, Virginia. She married graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson in 1895. Charles
            Dana Gibson was the creator of the iconic Gibson Girl sketches. Popular history
            suggests that Irene Langhorne (wife of Charles Dana Gibson) and her sister (Nancy
            Astor née Langhorne, married to British politician Waldorf Astor) were the
            inspirations for the Gibson Girl. </p>
         <p><strong>Hiser, Henry</strong>.
            
            After a night of drinking, Henry Hiser crashed an automobile carrying approximately
            seven 
            passengers and fled the scene ("Two Girls Burned and Crushed 
            Beyond Human Resemblance"). James J. McIntyre refers to this accident in his letter 
            to Gladys M. Stephens of 04 October 1909, and insists that he has moved on from such
            a lifestyle.
            </p>
         <p><strong>Holland, Mr</strong>.
            Jame McIntyre's letter to Gladys Stephens on 8-13-1909 repeatedly mentions Mr. Holland
            as someone who 
            served as a kind of guide to Gladys while she was in Portland.</p>
         <p><strong>Hughes, Mrs</strong>.
             In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys Stephens describes travelling
            with a Virginian named Mrs. Hughes. Mrs. Hughes is described as the cousin of Mrs.
            Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as the cousin of a Mrs. Jordon who has
            two
            sons. </p>
         <p><strong>Ivalor</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys Stephens notes that
            she had just written to Ivalor.</p>
         <p><strong>Jays</strong>.
            Gladys mentions that the Jays supplied her with the address for Roswel a night after
            mailing him a note in her
            September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens.</p>
         <p><strong>Jones, Mr</strong>.
            James McIntyre's letter on 8-13-1909 mentions Mr. Jones as an acquaintance of Gladys's
            from 
            back home.</p>
         <p><strong>Jordon, Mrs</strong>.
             In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys Stephens describes Mrs. Jordon
            as a cousin of Mrs. Hughes (one of Gladys' travelling companions, a Virginian). Mrs.
            Jordon is described as having two sons and a dead husband. </p>
         <p><strong>L, Mrs</strong>.
            
            A Mutual friend of Gladys Stephens and her mother, Mrs. L. lives in El Paso, presumably
            near Gladys.
            In her letter of September 6, 1909, Mrs. Stephens mentions making a pillow and sending
            it to Gladys to give to Mrs. L.
            In another letter (27 September 1909), Gladys tells her mother that she is teaching
            Mrs. L. to make 
            Boston Baked Beans.
            </p>
         <p><strong>Little Gladys</strong>.
             Little Gladys appears to be a young girl on the <i>S.S. Northwestern</i>, of whom James McIntyre seems to be fond. 
            </p>
         <p><strong>MaQs</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys
            Stephens asks if Mrs. Stephens has heard from the MacQ's lately, and wonders what
            
            "the
            madam think now."
            </p>
         <p><strong>Macphearson, Adelaide M</strong>.
            Gladys Stephens writes several letters to her mother about Adelaide's
            preparations for her wedding. In her September 27, 1909
            letter to her mother, she mentions that Adelaide has taken up dress making and
            has all her attention turned to "the West."</p>
         <p><strong>Maud</strong>.
            In a letter dated September 13, 1909, James Macyntire describes
            travelling with a person from Montana named Maud.</p>
         <p><strong>Maynard</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to her mother, Gladys Stephens
            asks whether Mrs. Stephens has heard anything of Maynard.</p>
         <p><strong>McIntyre [James McIntyre's father]</strong>.
            In his 8/23/1909 letter to Gladys Stephens, James McIntyre thanks Gladys Stephens
            for inquiring about his father and
            reports that his father is doing 
            "nicely."
            </p>
         <p><strong>McIntyre [James McIntyre's mother]</strong>.
            In his 8/23/1909 letter to Gladys Stephens, James McIntyre
            expresses his eagerness to tell his mother 
            "all about"
            
            Gladys.</p>
         <p><strong>McIntyre, James J</strong>.
            James J. McIntyre is a crewmember on the <i>S.S. Northwestern</i>. 
            He is enamoured with Gladys Stephens and writes to her often between the summer of
            1909 and 
            the fall of 1909 (and probably later). It is likely that McIntyre was a tramp enginner,
            a low-ranking 
            crewman who switches jobs frequently and has little formal training. Between his letters
            of 13 August 
            1909 and 04 October 1909, McIntyre transfers from the <i>Santa Clara</i> to the 
            <i>Northwestern</i>, and in the latter letter, he indicates that in one calendar 
            year he has worked on five different ships.</p>
         <p><strong>Nims, Mabel</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys
            Stephens notes that the last letter she wrote to Mabel Nims was so long ago that she's
            forgotten when it was.</p>
         <p><strong>Palmer, Herbert E.</strong> (b. June 1876).
            
            In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre mentions spending
            
            time with the <i>S.S. Northwestern's</i> purser's sister, whom he identifies as Irene Palmer. 
            Though McIntyre never mentions the purser by name, the 1900 U.S. Census shows that
            Irene 
            Palmer lived with two older brothers: Gilbert S. and Herbert E. Palmer. The 1910 Census
            
            indicates that Gilbert S. Palmer was still a member of the family household, while
            Herbert 
            E. Palmer is not listed, suggesting that the purser of whom Macintyre speaks is Herbert
            E. 
            Palmer. In fact, a Herbert E. Palmer corresponding with the relevant genealogical
            data 
            does not appear at all on the 1910 Census, but this is not surprising if we consider
            that 
            the itinerant nature of his duties on the <i>Northwestern</i> could have prevented his being 
            recorded for the 1910 Census. It is likely that he didn't die during this gap, as
            a Herbert 
            E. Palmer matching the relevant genealogical data is recorded in the 1920 Census.
            At this 
            point, he had married Mary Palmer, a first generation Bohemian-American whose parents
            
            emigrated from Bohemia, and the two lived in Pierce County, WA, which includes the
            greater 
            Tacoma area. The 1930 Census shows that Mary had died and Herbert had moved to Richmond,
            
            NY, though it also incorrectly estimates his birth year as 1877. It's likely that
            even though 
            McIntyre refers to Herbert as Irene Palmer's brother, he was in fact her half-brother.
            
            The 1930 Census indicates that both of Herbert's parents were born in Massachusetts,
            while 
            the head of the Palmer household, Gustavus Palmer, was born in Maine. Herbert's mother,
            
            Minnie T. Palmer, was born in Massachusetts, and didn't marry Gustavus until 1882,
            
            approximately 6 years after Herbert's birth 
            (United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1910; United States Census, 1920; 
            United States Census, 1920;
            United States Census, 1930).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Palmer, Irene</strong> (b. September 1892).
            
            In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre identifies
            
            Irene Palmer as the sister of the Purser on the S.S. Northwestern, and indicates 
            that she is 17 years old at the time of the letter. The 1900 U.S. Census records 
            that an Irene Palmer was born in September 1892 in Anderson Island, Washington, 
            which corroroborates her age in Macintyre's letter. The 1900 Census also shows 
            that Irene had two older brothers, which corroborates Macintyre's description of her
            
            as the only girl in her family. The 1910 U.S. Census records Irene Palmer's city of
            
            residence as Tacoma, which would likely be her city of residence a year earlier at
            
            the time of Macintyre's letter dated 04 October 1909. Tacoma's proximity to the Alaska
            
            Steamship Company's headquarters in Seattle argues for the plausibility of Irene Palmer
            
            hitching a ride to spend time with her brother and to see the landscape of the Pacific
            
            Northwest 
            (United States Census, 1900; 
            United States Census, 1910).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Pauline</strong>.
            In her letter to her mother of October 5, 1909, Gladys Stephens
            mentions that she has written to Pauline but still needs to mail the letter.</p>
         <p><strong>Philip</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to her mother, Gladys
            Stephens notes that she never heard from Philip.</p>
         <p><strong>Reyes, Bernardo</strong>.
            In Gladys's letter to her mother postmarked 
            24 September 1909, she mentions the Mexican people's opposition 
            towards Vice-President Reyes.</p>
         <p><strong>Rich, Mrs</strong>.
            In her August 8, 1909 letter to her mother, Gladys Stephens 
            remarks that she fails 
            "to see the point of Mrs. Rich's joke."
            </p>
         <p><strong>Roswel</strong>.
            In her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens, Gladys
            Stephens notes she hasn't heard from Roswel lately.</p>
         <p><strong>Scotchman</strong>.
            "The Scotchman" may be Adelaide's fiance, as evidenced 
            by the correspondance between Gladys Stephens and James McIntyre in the late summer
            and early autumn of 1909.</p>
         <p><strong>Smith, Berenice</strong>.
            
            A Mutual friend of Gladys and her mother, Berenice Smith is mentioned as being a person
            that Gladys
            might get to check in on her mother if she doesn't write back on 06 September 1909.
            Presumably, Berenice Smith
            lived in Newton near the Stephens family.
            </p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Albert T.</strong> (b. est. 1856).
            Gladys Stephens's father.</p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Alex C</strong>.
            In her letter dated August 8, 1909, Gladys 
            mentions her "Uncle Alex" a number of times.  It is apparent that he is facilitating
            social connections for her in Texas, prior to her arrival, so we can assume he lives
            in El Paso.</p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Gladys Mary</strong> (b. est. 1892).
            A Gladys Mary Stephens from Newton, MA appears in lists of "Special Students"
            in the <cite>Boston University Yeark Book</cite> for 1907 and 1909, but
            not for 1908. According to the <cite>Year Book</cite> for 1907, students
            could be admitted as special students if they were "taking one or more particular
            course of work, without being a candidate for a degree," were "deficient on prelimiary
            preparation," or had "not passed the full number of examinations required for
            admission" to the class to which they sought admission. Special students were
            classified in three groups, and Stephens appears in lists of the first group (Group
            A), "those enrolled in the College [of Liberal Arts] only" (special students in the
            other groups were enrolled in "Teachers' Courses" or in other departments of the
            University.</p>
         <p><strong>Stephens, Jennie M. (Mrs. Albert T. Stephens)</strong> (b. ca. 1862).
            Gladys Stephens's mother.</p>
         <p><strong>Thomases</strong>.
            In Gladys' September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens she asks how the Thomases
            are.</p>
         <p><strong>Virginians</strong>.
             In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes traveling
            with a group of Virginians. She describes them as "jolly." The only Virginian
            described in detail is Mrs. Hughes; she is described as the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson
            and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as the cousin of a Mrs. Jordon who has two sons.
            </p>
         <p><strong>Ward, Will</strong>.
            Gladys remarks on Will Ward's marriage in her September 27, 1909 letter to Mrs A.T.
            Stephens and asks
            where Jack Ward is living.</p>
         <p><strong>Wards</strong>.
            The Wards are a family that includes both Will Ward and Jack Ward.  Gladys writes
            in her September 27, 1909
            letter to Mrs. A.T. Stephens wondering who is in the Ward's Portland house.</p>
