            <lb/>Talk abut roses, there
            <lb/>are so many here that
            <lb/>I can't think what
            <lb/>California will be like.
            <lb/>I went today with
            <lb/>the <rs>Virginians</rs>. The men
            <lb/>were hunting up old
            <lb/>friends here in the
            <lb/>city. I have a lot of
            <lb/>truck, which I am going

            <lb/>are four pictures of

            <lb/>exquisite—they are
            <lb/>as natural as pictures
            <lb/>can be. My <rs>Princetonian</rs>
            <!-- Is "and" written at an angle a form of highlighting? -->
            <lb/>got them for me, and

            <!-- What do I do about the repeated letterhead? -->
            <lb/>paid a dollar for

            <lb/>I got at the Japanese

            <lb/>Dear mother,
            <lb/>Was awfully
            <lb/>glad to hear from you.
            <lb/>Doubt if we can go to
            <!-- Stuff -->
            <lb/>Alaska -- can't get stateroom
            <lb/>so many are going.
            <lb/>Have located the Goulds,
            <lb/>I telephoned today but she
            <lb/>was at the Expo. Got
            <lb/>him <unclear cert="high">on</unclear> the phone and I
            <lb/>will call later.
            <!--new paragraph-->
            <lb/>Mrs. Hughes (the Virginian)
            <lb/>is a cousin of Mrs. <unclear cert="medium">Dana</unclear>
            <lb/>Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf

            <!-- Page break here -->
            <lb/>visit them. Mrs. Jordon
            <lb/>(Mrs. H's cousin) has lots of
            <lb/>money. Her husband died
            <lb/>5 yrs. ago and left a large
            <lb/>estate. One of the sons
            <lb/>"blew in" $40,000 in 2 yrs.
            <lb/><unclear cert="high">They</unclear> could buy ranch
            <lb/>for $12,000 and pay $25,000
            <lb/>for improvements. The girl
            <lb/>has her money too. Her
            <lb/>mink coat only cost $600.
            <lb/>I might do worse than
            <lb/>to visit the family don't
            <lb/>you think. They tried to
            <lb/>have me promise to visit
            <lb/>them.
            <lb/>Not much to write
            <lb/>about now so I guess
            <!-- Page break -->
            <lb/>that I'll stop.
