            <education>A Gladys Mary Stephens from Newton, MA appears in lists of "Special Students"
              in the <title level="m">Boston University Yeark Book</title> for 1907 and 1909, but
              not for 1908. According to the <title level="m">Year Book</title> for 1907, students
              could be admitted as special students if they were "taking one or more particular
              course of work, without being a candidate for a degree," were "deficient on prelimiary
              preparation," or had "not passed the full number of examinations required for
              admission" to the class to which they sought admission. Special students were
              classified in three groups, and Stephens appears in lists of the first group (Group
              A), "those enrolled in the College [of Liberal Arts] only" (special students in the
              other groups were enrolled in "Teachers' Courses" or in other departments of the
              University.</education>

                Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians" and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings.

            <lb/>We arrived in <placeName>Seattle</placeName>
            <lb/>at 7:20 this morning.  It was
            <lb/>rather rough last night, but
            <lb/>it was just from the wind.
            <lb/>It was the only rough place we
            <lb/>had coming back.  We had a 
            <lb/>dandy time coming back.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>As a souvenir I have the
            <lb/>official list of the passangers
            <lb/>who sailed from <placeName>Seattle</placeName>.  It
            <lb/>was posted by the Purser, and
            he gave it to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>I'd like to know what is
            <lb/>the matter with <persName>auntie</persName>.  I
            <lb/>sent her cards from <placeName>Yellowstone</placeName>
            <lb/>and some from here — among 
            <lb/>them a leather <rs> <abbr>A.Y.P.</abbr>card</rs>.
            <lb/>I sent her some from <placeName>Alaska</placeName>.
            <lb/>also. Almost every time I
            <lb/>sent you one I sent her one.

          <p>
            <lb/>I was not sick once while I
            <lb/>was gone.  I am enough fatter
            <lb/>so that the people here at the 
            <lb/>hotel spoof of it.  I'm more
            <lb/>tanned also.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>A <placeName>Texas</placeName>judge who is worth
            <lb/>3 million was on the ship coming
            <lb/>back with his wife, two daughters
            <lb/>and 2 grandsons.  He owns a ranch
            <lb/>in <placeName>Texas</placeName>which is about 12
            <lb/>miles square.  They have invited
            <lb/>me to visit them, and <persName>Uncle
              <lb/>Alex</persName>wants me <unclear reason="homophone confusion">too</unclear>.  He may
            <lb/>have a business motive. I
            <lb/>will likely stop there for 2 or 3
            <lb/>days.  He wants to take me to
            <lb/>a real southern hunt.  I can
            <lb/>have a pony all for myself he
            <lb/>said.  It is an opportunity not
            <lb/>to be lost, don't you agree?

            <lb/>We had a great time last night-

            <lb/>in before 12 some not until
            <lb/>2.  I did at 12.  It seems awfully
            <lb/>funny to be on land again.
            <lb/>They certainly were glad to see
            <lb/>us here at the hotel.

            <lb/>I had hoped she would keep me posetd as to

            <lb/>things to tell you. I have thought of her very 
            <lb/>often. Give my love to her when you see or write 
            <lb/>her and tell her about my baby boy. You must 
            <lb/>have missed her a very great deal. I hope you 
            <lb/>are well. I am not able to do any house work yet.

          <p> <lb/>Have just  
            <lb/>returned from a 
            <lb/>birthday luncheon 
            <lb/>and this evening 
            <lb/>I am going out to 
            <lb/>dinner at another 
            <lb/>house. 
          </p>
          <p> <lb/>It is as warm 
            <lb/>today as a July 
            <lb/>day at home. It 
            <lb/>will be cool this 
            <pb facs="/a/abcb7505-b573-47fe-9f87-9d457cda0c26"/>evening however.

          <p> <lb/> <persName>Adelaide</persName> is 
            <lb/>getting along  
            <lb/>finely with her  
            <lb/>shopping. Her 
            <lb/>evening hat will  
            <lb/>cost $52.95. How's that?
            <lb/>Everything else 
            <lb/>accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>I am wondering
            <lb/>what you think
            <lb/>of the pictures.

            <lb/>wanted you to
