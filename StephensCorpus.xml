            Diaz of Mexico met in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. This was the first official meeting between the Presidents
            of Mexico and the United States. Local news sources commented on American and Mexican displays of wealth 
            and pagentry. The U.S. State Department retains a copy of the protocol for the event as well as drafts of 
            President Diaz's proposed toast. The State Department does not record the content of Taft and Diaz's 
            conversations, but they may have discussed U.S. support of Diaz's increasingly threatened regime or the 
            territorial dispute over the Chamizal area along the Rio Grande just south of El Paso.</desc>

          <p> This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
            editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
            the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
            editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
            Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
            being revised), "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
            William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
            height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864, and "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by
            Samuel Sullivan Cox. These documentary editions are intended
            to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
            for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
            for studying those texts. </p>
          <p> Each text was edited in connection with a graduate course offered
            by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
            courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
            and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
            from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
            vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
            in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
            interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
            that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
            tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
          <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
            non</foreign>, the Stephens edition also explores ways of telling four stories
            inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
            texts, the history of the physical letters (including their recent restoration), the
            editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
            the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

          <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
          images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
          full quality before being loaded into an image server that provides zoomable views of the
          production images. All edges of manuscript pages were
          overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image

          element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
          &lt;pb&gt; element includes an &quot;mmid&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID
          of a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application, as well as

            breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the physical
          constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are encoded

          &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
          the markup. Each entry contains an &lt;opener&gt; element—which in turn contains a
          &lt;dateline&gt; element—and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
          &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a &quot;type&quot; attribute containing one of
          the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
          &quot;value&quot; attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The &lt;div1&gt;
          elements also contain &quot;audiostart&quot; and &quot;audioend&quot; elements that
          identify the section of the audio edition that corresponds to that entry. </p>
        <p>Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
          by indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
          a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
          &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes. </p>
        <p>If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
          &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of the entry (i.e., within the

              could be admitted as special students if they were "taking one or more particular

              admission" to the class to which they sought admission. Special students were
              classified in three groups, and Stephens appears in lists of the first group (Group
              A), "those enrolled in the College [of Liberal Arts] only" (special students in the

              that she is 17 years old at the time of the letter. The 1900 U.S. Census records 
              that an Irene Palmer was born in September 1892 in Anderson Island, Washington, 
              which corroroborates her age in Macintyre's letter. The 1900 Census also shows 
              that Irene had two older brothers, which corroborates Macintyre's description of her 
              as the only girl in her family. The 1910 U.S. Census records Irene Palmer's city of 
              residence as Tacoma, which would likely be her city of residence a year earlier at 
              the time of Macintyre's letter dated 04 October 1909. Tacoma's proximity to the Alaska 
              Steamship Company's headquarters in Seattle argues for the plausibility of Irene Palmer 
              hitching a ride to spend time with her brother and to see the landscape of the Pacific 
              Northwest.

            <note type="biographical">
              In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre speaks of spending 
              time with the S.S. Northwestern's purser's sister, whom he identifies as Irene Palmer. 
              Though McIntyre never mentions the purser by name, the 1900 U.S. Census shows that Irene 
              Palmer lived with two older brothers: Gilbert S. and Herbert E. Palmer. The 1910 Census 
              indicates that Gilbert S. Palmer was still a member of the family household, while Herbert 
              E. Palmer is not listed, suggesting that the purser of whom Macintyre speaks is Herbert E. 
              Palmer. In fact, a Herbert E. Palmer corresponding with the relevant genealogical data 
              does not appear at all on the 1910 Census, but this is not surprising if we consider that 
              the itinerant nature of his duties on the Northwestern could have prevented his being 
              recorded for the 1910 Census. It's likely that he didn't die during this gap, as a Herbert 
              E. Palmer matching the relevant genealogical data is recorded in the 1920 Census. At this 
              point, he had married Mary Palmer, a first generation Bohemian-American whose parents 
              emigrated from Bohemia, and the two lived in Pierce County, WA, which includes the greater 
              Tacoma area. The 1930 Census shows that Mary had died and Herbert had moved to Richmond, 
              NY, though it also incorrectly estimates his birth year as 1877. It's likely that even though 
              Macintyre refers to Herbert as Irene Palmer's brother, he was in fact her half-brother. 
              The 1930 Census indicates that both of Herbert's parents were born in Massachusetts, while 
              the head of the Palmer household, Gustavus Palmer, was born in Maine. Herbert's mother, 
              Minnie T. Palmer, was born in Massachusetts, and didn't marry Gustavus until 1882, 
              approximately 6 years after Herbert's birth.

            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes travelling with a Virginian named Mrs. Hughes who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor.  Mrs. Dana Gibson is likely a reference to Irene Langhorne, originally of Danville, Virginia.  She married graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson in 1895.  Charles Dana Gibson was the creator of the iconic Gibson Girl sketches.  Popular history suggests that Irene Langhorne (wife of Charles Dana Gibson) and her sister (Nancy Astor nee Langhorne, married to British politician Waldorf Astor) were the inspirations for the Gibson Girl.

"Mrs. Waldorf Astor" likely refers to Nancy Astor, wife of British Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, Waldorf Astor.  Nancy Astor became the first female Member of Parliament when she succeeded her husband as MP for Plymouth Sutton in 1919; she served until 1945.  Along with her sister, Mrs. Dana Gibson (nee Irene Langhorne), Nancy Astor served as inspiration for the iconic Gibson Girl sketches penned by her brother in law, Charles Dana Gibson.

                Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians" and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings.

She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then talks about her travel companion Mrs. Hughes.  She particularly describes Mrs. Hughes' famous cousins Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and now-deceased husband.

                Gladys tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
                a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news or gossip 
                of friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other individuals; 
                and brags about being shown around by Uncle Alex and the "plans for next summer" already in the works.
              </p>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead stationery
                measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
                body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
                The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring approximately
                2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS |
                PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
                corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted that other letters
                in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from the same hotel, are 
                likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's excursion to Alaska,
                the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration rather than a photo, and depicts
                the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side of the building. 
                The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style than the slanted script)
                and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's names are printed
                ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
                The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"), and so
                Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of center, inside the
                bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within the boundaries of the 
                letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style (some page numbers are followed
                by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>
              <accMat corresp="#GS19090808env">Accompanied by a stamped, cancelled, cream-colored envelope of Hotel Georgian stationery
                measuring 6.5 x 3.625 inches. A 1.375 x 2.4375-inch photographed image of the Hotel
                Georgian facade is printed on the left-hand side of the envelope above the hotel's
                address.  Incidentally, the image of the hotel on the envelope corresponds with the 
                image of the hotel facade on the outdated Hotel Georgian stationery.  The stamp is
                also upside down.</accMat>

            <lb/>We arrived in <placeName>Seattle</placeName>
            <lb/>at 7:20 this morning.  It was
            <lb/>rather rough last night, but
            <lb/>it was just from the wind.
            <lb/>It was the only rough place we
            <lb/>had coming back.  We had a 
            <lb/>dandy time coming back.

            <lb/>As a souvenir I have the
            <lb/>official list of the passangers
            <lb/>who sailed from <placeName>Seattle</placeName>.  It
            <lb/>was posted by the Purser<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="Purser"/><note resp="ed" xml:id="Purser">The Purser on a cruise ship traditionally has several important responsibilities.  
              They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit
              and bringing them aboard.  The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations.  Their duties are similar in definition to the steward.  So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners
            of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained said "official list of the passangers"
            from the Purser.<bibl><ref> target="#MarineWatch"</ref></bibl></note>, and
            he gave it to me.

            <lb/>I'd like to know what is
            <lb/>the matter with <persName>auntie</persName>.  I
            <lb/>sent her cards from <placeName>Yellowstone</placeName>
            <lb/>and some from here — among 
            <lb/>them a leather<abbr> A.Y.P.</abbr> card.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="card"/><note resp="ed" xml:id="card">The "A.Y.P. cards" Gladys
            mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.  A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which
            are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition
            in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers
            were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals
            and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others 
            are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle
            is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually
            banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens
            to mail one.</note>

            new hotel in Seattle when these visitors were staying there, built only one year before in 1908.  It had seven floors and

              Since the French Revolution in the 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered effeminate.
              Though JJM is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can see how the dominant culture would have found dancing
              in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside women through ballroom dancing. We 
              do not know if he only attended these gatherings with his male friends or if women would join their group, but in the following 
              lines of JJM's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him about being a <q>"better boy"</q>. He seems to be 
              referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party or dance.

                Writing from El Paso, Gladys evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
                and fiance, as well as Gladys's experience with head lice, which she 
                picked up in Mexico. Gladys also explains to her mother that she is 
                staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
                witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
                explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz, 
                Vice-President Reyes, and the general populace. Though Gladys is 
                definitely writing from El Paso, her exact location within the city 
                is unknown. Her letter is on stationary from the Office of the Treasurer
                in Santa Cruz, California, but the postmark indicates she mailed the 
                letter from El Paso. In her letter, she mentions how her Uncle wants
                her to extend her stay in El Paso, which suggests she might be staying
                with him, but then she discusses her extensive time spent with Adelaide,
                which suggests she is staying with her.

              <p> ALS. Two loose sheets of cream-colored Office of the Treasurer, Santa Cruz County, California
                 letterhead stationary measuring 8.56 x 11 inches. The front of each sheet of letterhead contains
                 a 2.125 x 2 inch black and white image of a building in the upper left corner of the page and 
                 an image of flowers with a scroll bearing the words "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CALIFORNIA," along with
                 a medallion emblazoned with the words "Office of Treasurer." The combined image of the scroll, 
                 flowers, and medallion measures 2.125 x 4.25 inches. Underneath the image is text that reads 
                 "W.H. BIAS Treasurer" and "R.W. BIAS Deputy Treas.," followed by a line for the date partially
                 pre-printed as "________ / 1___." The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, though there is some
                 reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive. The paper has 
                 light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides and that are 
                 0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting 3.063 inches
                 from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet. On the 
                 back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue until 0.1875 inches
                 from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets were placed 
                 together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin, but not overly
                 fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND." When viewing 
                 the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.</p>

                  by a stamped, cancelled, dark cream-colored envelope made from heavy paper and measuring
                  5.875 x 3.5 inches.There is a printed black and white image measuring 2.75 x 1.875 inches 
                  of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG RAFT 
                  COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark is
                  from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A. T. Stephens, 
                  26 Emerson Street, Newton, Massachusets." There is an additional endorsement on the envelop in a different
                  hand than the written address of a circled 10, then a 9/25. The 25 is also circled. The envelope
                  is cleanly slit along the right edge.

              from the altar to a train or boat" to "wear a becoming street dress of ladies' cloth, veiling, or silk, in a pale shade of blue" (Holt 238). Holt adds that if the bride wears this 
              in place of the traditional white wedding gown, her hat is one of "the chief adjuncts of this toilette" (238). Based on Gladys's description of Adelaide's wedding attire in this 
              letter and in her letter to her mother dated October 5, 1909, Adelaide seems to be preparing for a wedding that either takes place before noon or one from which she and her husband

                McIntyre relates the ship schedule and route for the S.S. Northwestern and spending time with the Purser's 
                sister in the Ketchikan area. He discusses pictures received from Gladys, and details specifications of the Northwestern compared 
                to the Santa Clara. McIntyre recounts two auto accidents in the Seattle area and reflects on their meaning for him.

                ALS. Two loose sheets of dirty white Alaska Steamship Company letterhead stationery 
                measuring 10.875 inches by 8.5 inches, with light blue horizontal lining on the recto 
                beginning 2.75 inches from the top and spaced .375 inches apart. Above the 
                lining, centered at the top of the page, and measuring 4.25 inches by .25 inches is 
                "Alaska Steamship Company", below which and right-justified is a solid black line 
                interrupted by "190" for the date of composition. Measuring approximately 1 inch 
                by 1 inch at the top left corner of the recto is the Alaska Steamship Company 
                logo, reading "Alaska | Steamship Co. | Black Ball | Line" over a black sphere in front 
                of a staff and flag with a black circle centered on a white background. At the extreme 
                top left of the recto, in small block text, is "form 1 10m 8-09". A variably and 
                transversally placed watermark is visible on the right side of the recto, reading 
                "Shawano | Mills". The watermark is variably and horizontally truncated by the 
                right edge of the recto through "Shawano", which measures roughly 5 inches 
                horizontally and would measure 1 inch vertically if the letters were not truncated. 
                "Mills" measures roughly 3 inches by 1 inch.

                Envelope. Accompanied by a cream colored envelope measuring 5.4375 inches by 3.125 inches, 
                postmarked for Seattle, Wash. on Oct 5, 1909. The postmarked time of day is only 
                partially legible. The cancellation reads "World's | Fair | Seattle | 1909" in a 
                sected compartment. A comma-like marking in a circle is inscribed in pencil on the 
                bottom quadrant of the back of the envelope, and a "9" followed by a circled "28&#x00BD;" 
                is written in pencil on the right side of the back of the envelope.

              A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves from job to job. 
              In <title level="j">The Engineers' Review</title> volume 16 (1905), I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
              engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two jobs, even 
              though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
              They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> <bibl>
              <ref target="#ICL">Lloyd 18</ref></bibl>. It's unclear if McIntyre is stating that he has 
              worked with literally the same person on five different ships, but the historical context 
              suggests that he is stating that the tramp engineers with whom he has worked all have exhibited 
              similar personalities and professional habits.

              Here McIntyre seems to be referring to the boat on which he's currently sailing to catch up 
              with the Northwestern. The diminutive connotation fits with the boastful tone that he has 
              assumed to impress Gladys with the size and power of the Northwestern. Interestingly, the 
              term <hi rend="italics">soap box</hi> hasn't yet entered common usage as a way of designating a smaller, unpowered 
              or low-power vehicle. It's possible that the "soap box" is a lightboat, which appears in the 
              closer to McIntyre's letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909.
