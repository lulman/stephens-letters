            editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
            Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
            being revised), "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain
            William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the
            height of the American Civil War, 1862–1864, and "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by
            Samuel Sullivan Cox. These documentary editions are intended
            to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might otherwise be difficult
            for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users with a variety of tools
            for studying those texts. </p>
          <p> Each text was edited in connection with a graduate course offered
            by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
            courses aim to provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
            and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
            from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing is our
            vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
            in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
            interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
            that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
            tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
          <p> While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
            non</foreign>, the Doane edition also explores ways of telling four stories
            inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
            texts, the history of the physical journal (including its recent restoration), the
            editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
            the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

              In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 4 October 1909, John J. Macintyre identifies 
              Irene Palmer as the sister of the Purser on the S.S. Northwestern, and indicates 
              that she is 17 years old at the time of the letter. The 1900 U.S. Census records 
              that an Irene Palmer was born in September 1892 in Anderson Island, Washington, 
              which corroroborates her age in Macintyre's letter. The 1900 Census also shows 
              that Irene had two older brothers, which corroborates Macintyre's description of her 
              as the only girl in her family. The 1910 U.S. Census records Irene Palmer's city of 
              residence as Tacoma, which would likely be her city of residence a year earlier at 
              the time of Macintyre's letter dated 04 October 1909. Tacoma's proximity to the Alaska 
              Steamship Company's headquarters in Seattle argues for the plausibility of Irene Palmer 
              hitching a ride to spend time with her brother and to see the landscape of the Pacific 
              Northwest.

            <note type="biographical">
              In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 4 October 1909, John J. Macintyre speaks of spending 
              time with the S.S. Northwestern's purser's sister, whom he identifies as Irene Palmer. 
              Though Macintyre never mentions the purser by name, the 1900 U.S. Census shows that Irene 
              Palmer lived with two older brothers: Gilbert S. and Herbert E. Palmer. The 1910 Census 
              indicates that Gilbert S. Palmer was still a member of the family household, while Herbert 
              E. Palmer is not listed, suggesting that the purser of whom Macintyre speaks is Herbert E. 
              Palmer. In fact, a Herbert E. Palmer corresponding with the relevant genealogical data 
              does not appear at all on the 1910 Census, but this is not surprising if we consider that 
              the itinerant nature of his duties on the Northwestern could have prevented his being 
              recorded for the 1910 Census. It's likely that he didn't die during this gap, as a Herbert 
              E. Palmer matching the relevant genealogical data is recorded in the 1920 Census. At this 
              point, he had married Mary Palmer, a first generation Bohemian-American whose parents 
              emigrated from Bohemia, and the two lived in Pierce County, WA, which includes the greater 
              Tacoma area. The 1930 Census shows that Mary had died and Herbert had moved to Richmond, 
              NY, though it also incorrectly estimates his birth year as 1877. It's likely that even though 
              Macintyre refers to Herbert as Irene Palmer's brother, he was in fact her half-brother. 
              The 1930 Census indicates that both of Herbert's parents were born in Massachusetts, while 
              the head of the Palmer household, Gustavus Palmer, was born in Maine. Herbert's mother, 
              Minnie T. Palmer, was born in Massachusetts, and didn't marry Gustavus until 1882, 
              approximately 6 years after Herbert's birth.

                Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians" and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings.

                Gladys tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
                a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news or gossip 
                of friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other individuals; 
                and brags about being shown around by Uncle Alex and the "plans for next summer" already in the works.

            <physDesc>
              <p>This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead stationery
                measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
                body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
                The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring approximately
                2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS |
                PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
                corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted that other letters
                in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from the same hotel, are 
                likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's excursion to Alaska,
                the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration rather than a photo, and depicts
                the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side of the building. 
                The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style than the slanted script)
                and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's names are printed
                ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
                The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"), and so
                Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of center, inside the
                bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within the boundaries of the 
                letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style (some page numbers are followed
                by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>
              <accMat corresp="#GS19090808env">Accompanied by a stamped, cancelled, cream-colored envelope of Hotel Georgian stationery
                measuring 6.5 x 3.625 inches. A 1.375 x 2.4375-inch photographed image of the Hotel
                Georgian facade is printed on the left-hand side of the envelope above the hotel's
                address.  Incidentally, the image of the hotel on the envelope corresponds with the 
                image of the hotel facade on the outdated Hotel Georgian stationery.  The stamp is
                also upside down.</accMat>

            <lb/>We arrived in <placeName>Seattle</placeName>
            <lb/>at 7:20 this morning.  It was
            <lb/>rather rough last night, but
            <lb/>it was just from the wind.
            <lb/>It was the only rough place we
            <lb/>had coming back.  We had a 
            <lb/>dandy time coming back.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>As a souvenir I have the
            <lb/>official list of the passangers
            <lb/>who sailed from <placeName>Seattle</placeName>.  It
            <lb/>was posted by the Purser, and
            he gave it to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>I'd like to know what is
            <lb/>the matter with <persName>auntie</persName>.  I
            <lb/>sent her cards from <placeName>Yellowstone</placeName>
            <lb/>and some from here — among 
            <lb/>them a leather <rs> <abbr>A.Y.P.</abbr>card</rs>.
            <lb/>I sent her some from <placeName>Alaska</placeName>.
            <lb/>also. Almost every time I
            <lb/>sent you one I sent her one.

            <lb/>I was not sick once while I
            <lb/>was gone.  I am enough fatter
            <lb/>so that the people here at the 
            <lb/>hotel spoof of it.  I'm more
            <lb/>tanned also.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>A <placeName>Texas</placeName>judge who is worth
            <lb/>3 million was on the ship coming
            <lb/>back with his wife, two daughters
            <lb/>and 2 grandsons.  He owns a ranch
            <lb/>in <placeName>Texas</placeName>which is about 12
            <lb/>miles square.  They have invited
            <lb/>me to visit them, and <persName>Uncle
              <lb/>Alex</persName>wants me <unclear reason="homophone confusion">too</unclear>.  He may
            <lb/>have a business motive. I
            <lb/>will likely stop there for 2 or 3
            <lb/>days.  He wants to take me to
            <lb/>a real southern hunt.  I can
            <lb/>have a pony all for myself he
            <lb/>said.  It is an opportunity not
            <lb/>to be lost, don't you agree?

            <lb/>We had a great time last night-

            <lb/>in before 12 some not until

            <lb/>funny to be on land again.
            <lb/>They certainly were glad to see
            <lb/>us here at the hotel.

            <lb/>wished for a small baby, but 
            <lb/>now that he is here I am glad 
            <lb/>he is strong and perfect. If 
            <lb/>I can only keep him well I

            <lb/>I had hoped she would keep me posted as to

            <lb/>a great while now with many, many entertaining 
            <lb/>things to tell you. I have thought of her very 
            <lb/>often. Give my love to her when you see or write 
            <lb/>her and tell her about my baby boy. You must 
            <lb/>have missed her a very great deal. I hope you

                This letter details Gladys's evaluation of Adelaide's wedding purchases and fiance, as well as Gladys's experience with head lice, which she picked up in Mexico. Gladys also explains to her mother that she is staying in Mexico longer than she originally planned so she can see the President before he dies. She briefly explains the political tension in Mexico between Vice-President Reyes and the general populace.

            <lb/><persName ref="AMM">Adelaide</persName> is getting some lovely
            <lb/>things to be married in. She is having
            <lb/>a pale blue broadcloth dress made. She
            <lb/>has a handsome brown suit. Things are 
            <lb/>getting quite interesting I can tell
            <lb/>you. Just between you and I <persName ref="#THM">"the man"</persName>"the man"
            <lb/>has one bad feature. He takes a cocktail
            <lb/>now and then. No one here seems to
            <lb/>mind it. And of course I have said
            <lb/>nothing. He seems nice other ways and
            <lb/>every one speaks well of him. He has
            <lb/>a good position and makes in the
            <lb/>vicinity of $50 a week. Well all's
            <lb/>well that end's well. $50 a week
            <lb/>and all I would not marry him.
            <lb/>Of course he belongs to the <rs>club</rs> here and
            <lb/>the club's favorite drink is cocktail. I've 
            <lb/>noticed the odor about everytime I've 
            <lb/>seen him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <lb/>I have found out some startling
            <pb/>
            <lb/>information today. I went to the
            <lb/><rs>hairdressers</rs> to have a shampoo.
            <lb/>On account of the amount of alkali
            <lb/>in the water people can not wash
            <lb/>their hair with it themselves. <persName ref="#AMM">Adelaide</persName>
            <lb/>and I made arrangements to go together
            <lb/>this morning. What do you suppose
            <lb/>the woman found--bugs in
            <lb/>my head! I got them in <placeName ref="#Mexico">Mexico</placeName>.
            <lb/>They all told me I'd be apt
            <lb/>to get them. I thought I'd escaped
            <lb/>however. Now what do you think
            <lb/>of that. Well she worked good
            <lb/>and hard and dosed my head and
            <lb/>I have to go again Sat. morning.
            <lb/>Their deposit was not large and
            <lb/>so we have hopes of soon cleaning
            <lb/>it all out. You can imagine
            <lb/>how I feel. There isn't on the
            <lb/>average one American in ten
            <lb/>who goes there without getting
            <lb/>loaded. Here's hoping I'll be clear
            <lb/>of it all soon.

            <lb/><rs ref="#ACS">Uncle</rs>says I must stay to

                Two loose sheets of dirty white Alaska Steamship Company letterhead stationery 
                measuring 10.875 inches by 8.5 inches, with light blue horizontal lining on the recto 
                beginning 2.75 inches from the top and spaced .375 inches apart. Above the 
                lining, centered at the top of the page, and measuring 4.25 inches by .25 inches is 
                "Alaska Steamship Company", below which and right-justified is a solid black line 
                interrupted by "190" for the date of composition. Measuring approximately 1 inch 
                by 1 inch at the top left corner of the recto is the Alaska Steamship Company 
                logo, reading "Alaska | Steamship Co. | Black Ball | Line" over a black sphere in front 
                of a staff and flag with a black circle centered on a white background. At the extreme 
                top left of the recto, in small block text, is "form 1 10m 8-09". A variably and 
                transversally placed watermark is visible on the right side of the recto, reading 
                "Shawano | Mills". The watermark is variably and horizontally truncated by the 
                right edge of the recto through "Shawano", which measures roughly 5 inches 
                horizontally and would measure 1 inch vertically if the letters were not truncated. 
                "Mills" measures roughly 3 inches by 1 inch.

            <note resp="ed" xml:id="JJM19091004note0">
              A "tramp engineer" designates an engineer who has little formal training and learns on the job. 
              Additionally, this kind of engineer is an interloper of sorts, frequently moving from job to job. 
              In <title level="j">The Engineers' Review</title> volume 16 (1905), I. C. Loyd defends the tramp 
              engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two jobs, even 
              though the tramp engineer also "won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
              They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody" <bibl>
              <ref target="#ICL">Loyd</ref></bibl>. It's unclear if Macintyre is stating that he has 
              worked with literally the same person on five different ships, or that he has found all 
              the tramp engineers to be frustratingly similar. The latter seems more likely considering 
              the pervasive negativity towards tramp engineers.
