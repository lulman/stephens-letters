            <education>A Gladys Mary Stephens from Newton, MA appears in lists of "Special Students"
              in the <title level="m">Boston University Yeark Book</title> for 1907 and 1909, but
              not for 1908. According to the <title level="m">Year Book</title> for 1907, students
              could be admitted as special students if they were "taking one or more particular
              course of work, without being a candidate for a degree," were "deficient on prelimiary
              preparation," or had "not passed the full number of examinations required for
              admission" to the class to which they sought admission. Special students were
              classified in three groups, and Stephens appears in lists of the first group (Group
              A), "those enrolled in the College [of Liberal Arts] only" (special students in the
              other groups were enrolled in "Teachers' Courses" or in other departments of the
              University.</education>

                measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. The front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
                body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
                The back side contains a .75-inch unlined head, with the body lined as on the front
                side. An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring approximately
                2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS |
                PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
                corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch halftone image of the Hotel Georgian facade. </p>

            <!--new paragraph-->
            <lb/>Mrs. Hughes (the Virginian)
            <lb/>is a cousin of Mrs. <unclear cert="medium">Dana</unclear>
            <lb/>Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf

            <!-- Page break here -->
            <lb/>visit them. Mrs. Jordon
            <lb/>(Mrs. H's cousin) has lots of
            <lb/>money. Her husband died
            <lb/>5 yrs. ago and left a large
            <lb/>estate. One of the sons
            <lb/>"blew in" $40,000 in 2 yrs.
            <lb/><unclear cert="high">They</unclear> could buy ranch
            <lb/>for $12,000 and pay $25,000
            <lb/>for improvements. The girl
            <lb/>has her money too. Her
            <lb/>mink coat only cost $600.
            <lb/>I might do worse than

            <lb/>you think. They tried to
            <lb/>have me promise to visit
            <lb/>them.
            <lb/>Not much to write
            <lb/>about now so I guess
            <!-- Page break -->
            <lb/>that I'll stop.

            <lb/>We had a great time last night- 
            <lb/>our last on board.  No one turned
            <lb/>in before 12 some not until
            <lb/>2.  I did at 12.  It seems awfully
            <lb/>funny to be on land again.
            <lb/>They certainly were glad to see
            <lb/>us here at the hotel.

            <lb/>seems to be the limit.  As for

            <lb/>He wants me to see all the 
            <lb/>people whom he knows.  He has
            <lb/>told them about my coming for

            <lb/>for next summer already.

            <lb/>feel that I have neglected 
            <lb/>you more than others for 
            <lb/>we have had so much on our 
            <lb/>minds and hands for the last
            <lb/>few weeks that we have left 
            <lb/>almost everyone else out. 
            <lb/>We have a nice baby boy. A 
            <lb/>good big baby not, not a little 
            <lb/>teeny weeny. <!-- colon? -->You know I 
            <lb/>wished for a small baby, but 
            <lb/>now that he is here I am glad 
            <lb/>he is strong and perfect. If 
            <lb/>I can only keep him well I 
            <lb/>shall be happy. I am not very 
            <lb/>strong yet but am gaining

            <lb/>every day a little, but I shall have to be 
            <lb/>careful for awhile yet. Gladys is pleased 
            <lb/>with her little brother and Willis is pleased 
            <lb/>with his little son. I have only heard from 
            <lb/>Gladys Stevens once. She was then in Colorado.
            <lb/>I had hoped she would keep me posetd as to 
            <lb/>her travels. I supposed she will be home before 
            <lb/>a great while now with many, many entertaining 
            <lb/>things to tell you. I have thought of her very 
            <lb/>often. Give my love to her when you see or write 
            <lb/>her and tell her about my baby boy. You must 
            <lb/>have missed her a very great deal. I hope you 
            <lb/>are well. I am not able to do any house work yet. 
            <lb/>Must not write any more this time. With love

          <p> <lb/>Have just  
            <lb/>returned from a 
            <lb/>birthday luncheon 
            <lb/>and this evening 
            <lb/>I am going out to 
            <lb/>dinner at another 
            <lb/>house. 
          </p>
          <p> <lb/>It is as warm 
            <lb/>today as a July 
            <lb/>day at home. It 
            <lb/>will be cool this 
            <pb facs="/a/abcb7505-b573-47fe-9f87-9d457cda0c26"/>evening however.

          <p> <lb/>I am as well as

          <p> <lb/>Adelaide is 
            <lb/>getting along  
            <lb/>finely with her

            <lb/>cost $52.95. How's that?
            <lb/>Everything else
