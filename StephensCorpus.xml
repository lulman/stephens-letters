              <p><emph rend="bold">Selection of the Source Texts</emph>. This edition of fifteen signed, autograph letters offers a
                necessarily selective view of the 899 separate items listed in the finding aid for
                the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of Stephens Family Letters and Ephemera held in the
                Rare Books and Manuscript collection of The Ohio State University Libraries
                (SPEC.RARE.CMS.327). Half of the items in the collection are letters, most of which
                are accompanied by stamped, addressed envelopes, and most of the letters are
                relatively short: 376, or 84% of the letters, consist of 1 or 2 leaves. Postcards
                constitute the next largest group of items—191, or 21% of the total—followed by 140
                miscellaneous documents, including 33 name cards and various bills, receipts, and
                brochures. Finally, the collection includes 110 small photographs. The 622 dated
                items in the collection range from 1834 to 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date from between 1907
                and 1914, with another 3% from 1917. Ten of the 110 photographs are dated, the dates
                scattered through the years covered by the letters.</p>
              <p>Detailed physical and bibliographical descriptions of the
                materials contained in this electronic edition appear with the letters in the
                edition. More general information about the format of the other materials in the
                collection appears in the Libraries' finding aid, which can be downloaded

                While the Libraries' finding aid identifies 180 different individual and corporate correspondents or
                authors, and 24 different correspondees, Gladys Stephens emerges unquestionably
                as the central figure in the collection: she is listed as the recipient of 334 of
                the letters and 138 of the postcards, and as the author of 54 letters and
                postcards. Given the contraints of our project—especially the length of an academic term—we
                decided to work with a subset of the collection that suggests the richness of the whole but
                offers something of an epistolary narrative. The letters in the present edition tell the story of two young lives
                intersecting during the course of travel and work in the early twentieth-century United States of America.
                Gladys Stephens writes eight letters to her mother about her travels west through Yosemite National Park
                to visit the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exhibition in Seattle, then south along the California coast
                and east along the nation's southwest tier with a stop to visit an uncle in El Paso, Texas. At some
                point during her stay in Seattle, she strikes up a relationship with James J. McIntyre, a merchant sailor plying the southeastern
                coast of Alaska, who writes six letters to her during the summer and fall recounting his
                adventures. Another letter written by Gladys's aunt during that summer shares further information
                about Gladys's travels with her mother.

                  leads to another law—never to keep a letter, if possible. If it be interesting
                  beyond the usual, it probably has in it some things which had better be forgotten.
                  If it is commonplace, it is not worth the keeping. Old love-letters are often
                  profaned by careless eyes; old gossip is raked up. Of course there are
                  exceptions—charming letters with no sting in them. But they are exceptions. If all
                  letters were burned as soon as answered, there would be that much less trouble in
                  the world—as any lawyer can testify.<lb/><lb/>— Priscilla Leonard, <title level="a">The Laws of Letter
                  Writing</title> (<title level="m">Harper’s Bazaar</title>, November 1904)
                </quote>
              </p>
              <p> As any historian,
                rhetorician, or casual reader of personal letters—whether those of ancestors or
                historical figures—can testify, if people followed Priscilla Leonard’s advice in
                <title level="a">The Laws of Letter Writing</title> to burn letters as soon as they are answered, our
                personal and cultural histories would be poorer to the degree that the threads of
                any one individual’s experiences, perceptions, and practices contribute to the
                entire fabric of the past. More specifically, had Gladys M. Stephens (b. 1892?)
                followed Leonard’s advice, we would lack the rich tapestry of information about
                travel, tourism, commerce, courtship, and personal correspondence in the first
                decades of the twentieth century contained in the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of
                Stephens Family Letters and Ephemera housed in the Rare Books and Manuscripts
                collection at The Ohio State University Libraries (the dated items in the collection
                were written between 1834 and 1949, but two-thirds of the letters date from the
                decade before the U.S. entry into World War I). 
              </p>
              <p> Stephens emerges as the
                central figure in the 899 separate items in the collection. She is the recipient of
                334 of the 449 letters in the collection and 138 of the postcards, as well as the
                author of 54 letters and postcards. Presumably, we can thank her for violating
                Leonard’s law. We know little of Stephens's life beyond the experiences recorded in
                the letters. She was born in Newton, MA, attended Boston University in 1907 and 1909
                as a "special student" (<title level="m">Year Book</title>), and is listed in the 1920 U.S. Census as single
                and living at her parents' home in Newton. In the summer of 1909, at the age of 17,
                she set out on a cross-country trip that took her from Newton to Seattle—with a stop
                at Yellowstone National Park—to visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition and travel
                via steamer up the Inside Passage of southeast Alaska. At some point along the way,
                she met James J. McIntyre, a "tramp engineer" employed by the Alaska Steamship
                Company, and, judging by his letters to her, formed a romantic relationship with
                him. From Seattle, Stephens travelled via California to El Paso, TX to visit an
                uncle, arriving in the midst of revolutionary unrest in neighboring Mexico.
              </p>
              <p> This edition of selected
                letters from the collection presents fifteen letters written during the summer and
                fall of 1909, eight written by Stephens to her parents about her travels, six by
                McIntyre to Stephens in which he describes his work on various merchant ships and
                professes his love for Stephens, and one by Stephens’s cousin Cora Anderson to
                Stephens’s mother in which she inquires about Stephens. Together, these letters
                represent at three of the four genres of letter writing for which Priscilla Leonard
                offer laws: the personal letter, the social letter, and the love-letter—depending,
                of course, on how one limns the boundaries of the genres. As is the case with any
                personal correspondence, these letters invite at least two vectors of
                interpretation: how the writers understand and employ the genre and material
                practices of letter-writing, and how the writers’ words constitute a window looking
                onto the wider world. Students of epistolary rhetoric will find much of interest in
                the Stephens letters. For example, in <title level="a">The Laws of Letter Writing</title> Leonard cautions,
                <quote rend="blockquote">[W]hen we
                  must commit our fortunes to a written page, to be read, perhaps at an unpropitious
                  moment, hundreds of miles away, it behooves us to know how to make that written
                  page say what we would, and make the exact impression we desire. (1125)
                </quote>
              </p>
              <p> As if he had read and
                absorbed this caution, James McIntyre seems acutely aware of the dangers of making
                the wrong impression in his letter to Gladys Stephens of 21 August 1909: 
                <quote rend="blockquote">[H]ow I
                  wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being of quite a different
                  desposition [sic] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of mind and you not so
                  much so.
                </quote>
              </p>
              <p> And in a letter to her
                mother written on 6 July 1909 from Seattle, Stephens reflects, as she often does in
                her letters, on her own and others’ attention to the social obligations of letter
                writing: 
                <quote rend="blockquote">Havent
                  [sic] done much on the writing stunt. I wrote Miss Childs a steamer letter, one to
                  Gus, I think I wrote one to Roswel, and a dozen lines to Nat telling him that I
                  was having a dandy time—never knew where I was going next and did not know when
                  I'd be home; and hoped that he'd have as pleasant a summer as I was having. Found
                  nothing at the P.O. Gee! but I'd like to hear.
                </quote>
              </p>
              
              <p> Students of early
                twentieth-century history will also find much of interest in the letters, from
                McIntyre’s accounts of life on merchant vessels plying Alaska’s Inside Passage to
                Stephens’s accounts of traveling through Yellowstone National Park by stagecoach,
                visiting the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle, and observing political
                unrest in Mexico:              
                <quote rend="blockquote">Uncle
                  says I must stay to see the Presidents meet and then I can go home immediately
                  after that. He says Dias is so old (79) that I probably will never get another
                  chance to see anything of the kind again. A revolution in Mexico is imminent if
                  Dias dies. The Vice Pres. Reyes wants to be Pres. and the people hate him
                  terribly. They have to have Rurales every where [sic] to keep them quiet now even.

                represented” <bibl><ref target="#Chest">6-7</ref></bibl>. In his manual Chesterfield
                follows in a tradition of placing import on letter writing perhaps argued most early
                and fervently by Scottish rhetorician Hugh Blair. In his 1783 century rhetorical
                treatise <title level="m">Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</title>, Blair establishes
                letter writing as a employing the same teachable rhetorical skills of good taste and
                facility as other types of composition. By the turn of the century and the time of
                the <title level="m">Stephens Family Travel Letters</title> hundreds of letter
                writing manuals and etiquette books were being written and read, covering genres
                from the business letter to condolences on the breaking of an engagement. During
                this same time period, letter-writing among the middle class in the United States
                had been on the rise for some years. Nineteenth century changes in etiquette,
                education, travel, and commerce led to a culture that allowed, even required,
                correspondence to become central to social interactions.</p>
              
              <p><hi rend="bold">Accessibility and Affordability of Letter-Writing Materials</hi>. Perhaps most important in
                allowing wider access to personal correspondence were the Postage Acts of 1845 and
                1851, which lowered the cost of long-distance postage by connecting price to weight,
                rather than mileage <bibl><ref target="#LucilleS">Schultz 111</ref></bibl>.
                Accessibility of materials was also a major factor as emerging consumer culture “was
                fuelled by the onward rolling development of mass production, more efficient
                materials, efficient distribution and marketing, which generated changes in the
                nature of letter writing equipment” <bibl><ref target="#Nigel">Hall 91</ref></bibl>.
                In the letters written by Stephens and McIntyre, we can see the effects
                of the increased production of letter-writing materials, particularly in the printed
                stationery they both use. Starting at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
                stationery began to include decorative headings: “The decorative personal letter
                writing papers most frequently held views of places. This was no accident and did
                not develop for aesthetic reasons. It is a reflection of railway development and the
                increased potential for travel. Souvenir shops supplied much of this stationery, but
                a lot was also available in hotels, a tradition which still continues today”
                    <bibl><ref target="#Nigel">Hall 98</ref></bibl>. Although most letter-writing
                manuals from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries recommend using
                plain, unlined paper for personal letters, the easy accessibility of hotel
                stationery, as well as its status as evidence of one’s travels, may have been
                appealing to a new traveler like Stephens, especially as she wrote to family members
                back home who had probably not visited these locales. For McIntyre,
                accessibility while on board ships and cost were possibly two reasons that he would
                sometimes choose to use Alaska Steamship Company stationery, rather than more
                conventional note paper.</p>
              <p><hi rend="bold">Natural vs. Artistic Style in Letter Writing</hi>. Many composition manuals and etiquette guides of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
                portray correspondence as a social practice with very defined rules, a practice that would reveal the 
                character and training of the letter-writer. For example, Kingsland writes in her 1903 <title level="m">Book of Good Manners</title>, 
                “A letter tells more than the news it contains or the sentiment it expresses, – it is a revelation of the 
                character and culture of the writer, and although the matter depends upon mental and moral qualities, 
                the manner may be acquired by any one” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">375</ref></bibl>. The letters in this 
                collection, when read alongside instructions for polite and appropriate social correspondence, seem to 
                go against many of the accepted standards. For example, Stephens, who writes about contracting head lice in 
                Mexico and points out many of the faults of Adelaide’s fiancé, seems to be ignoring Kingsland’s directive against 
                writing about unpleasant things since “A letter carries with it an atmosphere, and the mood of the writer is contagious. 
                Write kindly of every one” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">389</ref></bibl>. Stephens’ constant stream of gossip, while not necessarily 
                unkind, might not be considered completely appropriate. McIntyre, on the other hand, has not fully attended to advice 
                about using correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling: “The character of the one addressed should be considered, and 
                the contents of the letter adapted to his tastes and temperament.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Mistakes in language or little 
                slips in the use of a verb, which may be overlooked in speaking, offend all our sensibilities when written” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">Kingsland 388</ref></bibl>. 
                McIntyre has many “little slips” and even seems to introduce intentional errors with words like “fink” (think). </p>
              <p>While these letters at times appear to defy standards, they may exemplify other aspects of advice to writers, which 
                often appeared alongside the admonitions cited above. For example, Kingsland leads into her warnings by saying, “Do not 
                be hampered by conventionality. Listen to your own thoughts and express them, even if they seem crude” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">387</ref></bibl>. 
                And immediately after stating that errors “offend all our sensibilities,” she adds that “The recipient of a letter is by
                courtesy bound to suspend all criticism – he must not even think deprecatingly of a letter received. 
                Many hesitate to write, fearing criticism” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">388</ref></bibl>. McIntyre does not seem 
                to have feared such criticism from Stephens, and Stephens seems to feel free to express her (perhaps crude) thoughts openly, 
                at least when writing to her mother.</p>
              <p>This contradiction in the advice about letter-writing has been pointed out by Schultz: “Toward the end of the century, 
                a number of writers recognised that the rules for letter writing they offered were ‘custom’, not transcendent. But I see 
                no writers who recognised that their claim that letters should be ‘simple, natural, and easy’ – descriptive terms that 
                appear over and over in chapters on letter-writing – were elaborate masks for very complex and artificial constructions or 
                that an elaborate irony was embedded in that instruction” <bibl><ref target="#LucilleS">121</ref></bibl>. White’s 
                <title level="m">Twentieth Century Etiquette</title> clearly demonstrates this contradiction: “Write as you would talk were 
                your correspondent present. Try and think over what you intend writing, and say it in the most natural way you can. This is 
                the highest art – to do everything in so artistic and finished a manner, that it will have the appearance of being a second 
                nature” <bibl><ref target="#WhiteA">234</ref></bibl>. In writing these letters, Stephens and McIntyre seem to be 
                following the first part of this advice, to view writing as a conversation, while sometimes disregarding the need for letters 
                to be “artistic and finished.” McIntyre’s long, rambling sentences with little to no punctuation, and Stephens’ string of gossip 
                about neighbors and friends, resemble a conversation more than they do the polished model letters that appear in composition texts of the time.</p>
              <p>The main reason given by most manuals for taking care in writing letters was the potential longevity  of the manuscript. Kingsland advises, 
                “Never write anything over your signature of which you might later be ashamed. Our letters are often longer-lived than ourselves, and may eventually 
                be read by eyes not yet open to the light” <bibl><ref target="#Kings">388</ref></bibl>. Wells gives an even stronger warning: “beware, and be even over-cautions, 
                rather than not cautious enough, for a letter may serve as a sure witness in cases where you might never suppose it could be used. It may live and bear testimony for 
                years – it does not change with time or circumstance – it is a warrantee deed of whose responsibility you can never be free” <bibl><ref target="#RWells">194-195</ref></bibl>. 
                These warnings, at least in the case of the Stephens family letters, were somewhat justified in that these letters are still being read, and now transferred 
                into digital format, over one hundred years after they were written. However, Stephens’ letters to her family are perhaps more 
                interesting to readers today in that they express her feelings and details of her daily life honestly, without ornamentation or censoring.</p>
                            
              <p><hi rend="bold">Travel and The Familial Letter</hi>. For the Stephens family,
                letter-writing was essential for staying in touch with far-flung family and friends,
                particularly for Gladys as she traveled across the United States to places that
                would not have been accessible to travelers before the nineteenth century. Schultz
                explicitly connects such travels to changes in the postal system: “Both cause and
                effect of this increased accessibility [to letter writing] was that the need for
                long-distance communication was increasing. As the Westward expansion continued, and
                as the Midwest and South became more populated, the personal correspondence of many
                US residents increased” <bibl><ref target="#LucilleS">111</ref></bibl>. While the
                increased ease and comfort of travel allowed for greater distances between people,
                personal correspondence maintained close ties between family members: “Throughout
                the nineteenth century, migration across the North American continent compelled many
                people to become letter writers, challenging them to image the genuinely vast
                physical distances traveled and to affirm – through a space and time that
                annihilated fellow travelers – connection with those they hoped their letters would
                reach” <bibl><ref target="#Deck">Decker 88</ref></bibl>. By sharing items of gossip,
                day-to-day events, and descriptions of people and places with her parents and
                others, Stephens created a sense of home even while far away.</p>
              <p>Especially following the
                debilitating effects of the American Civil War, the nation turned to the familial
                unit to heal. As rhetorical historian Nan Johnson writes, “the celebration of the
                American home and its promise for salvation for the nation…its potential to heal
                ‘disasters’ .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [were demonstrated] by courting a nostalgia for
                domesticity” <bibl><ref target="#Nanj">Johnson 90</ref></bibl>. Though Stephens writes
                to her mother and father more than forty years after the war has ended, the
                importance of the familial unit had not lost its hold. With the increasing problem
                of alcoholism and intemperance as argued by the Anti-Saloon League, Prohibition
                Party, and Women’s Christian Temperance movement, the maintenance of a close family
                was of dire importance. When a family member like Stephens left home, it was of keen
                importance, therefore, to maintain a sense of family through letter writing. Richard
                A. Wells argues in his 1894 <title level="m">Manners, Culture and Dress of the Best
                  American Society</title>, “Family correspondence is a great social privilege as
                well as a great necessity. It brings together divided members of the household, and,
                for the while, gives home a place in their hearts. Women always write these best…”
                    <bibl><ref target="#RWells">Wells 183</ref></bibl>. Serving this purpose of
                familial transport, the drives for clarity, perspicuity, and, above all, simplicity
                represented in these manuals takes on a new tenor—one should sound like oneself and
                “avoid all ‘stereotyped and stilted language’” in order to follow the oft repeated
                adage that letter writing was “simply to converse on paper, instead of by word of
                mouth” <bibl><ref target="#Shel">Sheldon 27</ref>;<ref target="#RWells">Wells
                    182</ref></bibl>. Thus, while antibellum letter manuals suggest more formal
                address between child and parent, post-bellum manuals argue for the less formal more
                casual style we see in Stephens’ letters home.</p>
              <p>Though Stephens might have been able to phone home when she was closer to Newton, 
                for those used to writing letters, the telephone seemed too casual&#x2014;“A note 
                of invitation requires answer by post; such a missive should not be dismissed by 
                telephone or telegraphic"&#x2014;or too formal&#x2014;“why the telephone which seems 
                more intimate [is] in reality more formal? We say something just to say something &#x0026; 
                yet underneath are striving” <bibl><ref target="#Putnam">Roberts 473</ref>;<ref target="#Roth">Rothman 224</ref></bibl>. 
                One also had to take care of what was said over the telephone for fear the operator 
                was listening in. And, yet, letter writing manuals also cautioned that one should not 
                write anything that one didn’t want a third party to read, for letters, especially letters 
                home, were often read aloud among family members. It is interesting, then, that Stephens pens 
                several relatively uncouth and gossipy statements (by the manuals’ standards, at least) to 
                her mother regarding the monetary situations of those she meets, her weight, her sunburn, etc.</p>
              
              <p><hi rend="bold">The Love Letter</hi>. Taking caution about
                unintended readers was specifically advised regarding the love letter. As
                Chesterfield warns, “Always compose your love-letters in a style that you would not
                be ashamed to have them fall into the hands of a third party” <bibl><ref
                    target="#Chest">57</ref></bibl>. Sheldon adds, arguing for the natural style
                mentioned above, that overly-florid language won’t help anyway because “no wise
                woman’s heart is won by silly flattery. On the contrary, insipid compliments tend
                only to disgust her” <bibl><ref target="#Shel">Sheldon 55</ref></bibl>. And yet,
                Sheldon also warns to men, “Be not too humble in your utterances, as great humility
                borders closely upon servility, and no right-minded woman desires a slave for a
                husband” <bibl><ref target="#Shel">56</ref></bibl>. As this last line suggests, the
                love letter and love letter manuals are rich places to explore gender relations of
                the early-1900s.</p>
              <p>For instance, in McIntyre’s
                letters to Stephens (we have no letters of hers to him) we often see him telling
                Stephens that she makes him “determined to do better” (10.11.09). As Ellen K. Rothman
                explains in her <title level="m">Hands and Hearts: A History of Courtship in
                  America</title>, women were thought to have morally purifying powers upon men who
                were “impelled by ‘animal instincts’.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Women could—indeed,
                must—help men in the struggle for self, control” <bibl><ref target="#Roth"
                  >186</ref></bibl>. One love letter Rothman quotes sounds very similar to
                McIntyre’s in its statement, “You are my good influence to keep me pure in
                heart.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Your influence makes me more manly” <bibl><ref target="#Roth">187</ref></bibl>. Yet
                as Rothman and Johnson argue, “the doctrine of female influence had long served to
                justify the subordination of woman: she did no need the vote since her innate
                superiority gave her so much influence” <bibl><ref target="#Roth">Rothman
                  189</ref></bibl>. Because women were seen as the paradigm of self-control and
                lodestones of morality, Rothman goes on, “The late nineteenth century view was that
                women, although more emotional and sensitive than men, loved less intensely”
                <bibl><ref target="#Roth">200</ref></bibl>. Thus, beyond Stephens simply not
                sharing McIntrye’s feelings, this learned repression might be one reason for
                McIntyre’s querying, “I wonder what you think of these letters of mine with us being
                of quite a different desposition [sic] in a way. Me of a very affectionate turn of
                mind and you not so much so” (8.20.09). This feminine temperance and control might
                also be an explanation for the little tests of love McIntyre seems to set up: for
                instance, he asks “I wonder what influence it would have on you to have some one put
                up an [argument?] against me” (9.11.09). He also, seemingly to stir up Stephens’
                passions, mentions in passing at least twice other women coming after him (9.11.09
                and 10.4.09).</p>
              <p>The role of the ideal woman
                was to resist and purify (sometimes to the point of being defined as “rhetorically
                meek”) and the role of the ideal man was to balance wooing and being purified
                    <bibl><ref target="#Nanj">Johnson 48</ref></bibl>. Within his wooing, however,
                the manuals suggest that a man still needs to maintain his manliness through
                avoiding “all exaggeration of statement and profusion of endearing epithets which
                characterizes morbid sentiment and makes one appear ridiculous” <bibl><ref
                    target="#Shel">Sheldon 56</ref></bibl>. McIntyre clearly does not heed this
                advice, consistently using his favorite epithet “Little Girl” to refer to Stephens.
                But Rothman suggests that this advice was typically not heeded, stating that,
                “‘little girl’ was not unusual. Beginning around 1880, couples began to use ‘little
                girl’ and ‘little boy’ as terms of endearment. It seems logical that men and women
                raised in the increasingly child-centered, emotionally dependent families
                characteristic of late Victorian middle classes would associate intimacy with the
                parent-child relationship and feel comfortable addressing each other by a term that
                evoked the closeness and dependency of childhood” <bibl><ref target="#Roth">Rothman

              <p><hi rend="bold">Men and Romantic Love</hi>.
                Some of the most prominent themes that we notice working in the Stephen family letters, particularly through the intimate relationship 
                between James J. McIntyre and Gladys Stevens deal with romance, desire, and a longing to be near loved ones. Although we do not know 
                all of the details of their relationship, in his love letter to Gladys on August 21st 1909, James J. McIntyre opens up the possibility 
                for the representation of emotional culture at the time. In their article “Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th-Century Change” Peter 
                N. Stearns and Mark Knapp reinforce and document the theme of love for American middle-class men while also discussing dating practices from 
                the Victorian period onto the Early 20th century. <bibl><ref target="#ML">Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th-Century Change</ref></bibl>
              </p>
              <p>
                From his letters to Gladys, we certainly do know that James J. McIntyre was of working class status. He often mentions his experiences 
                and duties on board ship as a merchant marine, which included keeping watch at night, travelling along the Pacific Northwest, and following 
                orders from both the Chief and Captain on board. Less is known about his physical appearance, at least nothing is mentioned in this one letter, 
                but he does recall his youth and reflects on how he used to go out dancing with his friends, which tells us that he was certainly a social person. 
              </p>
              <p>
                What we notice from his love letters to Gladys, is that McIntyre is writing within a larger social context dealing specifically with love ideals 
                for men. By the nineteenth century, men were redefining male standards for love arguing that <q>“it was only through love that their true selves could 
                  shine through”</q> <bibl><ref target="#ML">Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing a 20th Century Change</ref></bibl> Although McIntyre is writing at a 
                later time, these cultural standards shaped the way for multiple decades after the 19th century. Indeed, as we see in his letters, McIntyre often 
                talks about how much he misses Gladys. Historically, men in and around the time that this letter was written, accepted <q>“the pain that love could 
                  bring, sometimes noting their jealousy when a lover showed interest in others, even more commonly citing their grief when a loved one was absent”</q>. 
                In his letter, McIntyre makes it clear that he wants to be near Gladys: <q>“here we are Dear me plowing along miles farther away every day when it is 
                  my desire to be with you”</q>. We do not know if Gladys had more than one love interest but in this case it seems like her and McIntyre had a working 
                romance going on before and during his life as a merchant marine. 
              </p>
              <p>
                By the Early 20th century, which is when McIntyre wrote to Gladys, new trends were emerging for men in terms of their commitment towards women. 
                According to Stearns and Knapp, <q>“What was beginning to happen, by the 1920’s, was a virtual reversal of Victorian notions: whereas in the 19th 
                  century men had accepted the principle of deep love in a context of substantial differentiation and separation from women, they now enjoyed more 
                  routine contact but devised a less committed version of romance in compensation”</q>. <bibl><ref target="#ML">Men and Romantic Love: Pinpointing 
                    a 20th-Century Change</ref></bibl>. One of the reasons for this change was in part because there was a growing separation between work and home. 
                Indeed, McIntyre was separated from Gladys, but with a difference: not because he was not committed, but due to the kind of work he did that prevented 
                him from close contact. In fact, McIntyre seems to be the opposite of not being committed, he holds Gladys in high esteems and he longs to be with her.

              <p><hi rend="bold">Railroads and The Promotion of Tourism in the American West</hi>. The letters written by Gladys Stevens, documenting both the ordinary and extraordinary details of her various excursions, prompt readers to make inquiries of different kinds about the nature of tourism in the first decade of the twentieth century.  
                On one hand, we wonder about Gladys the person: what were her reasons for taking an extended trip into the Pacific Northwest, how did she as a young single woman have the means to do so, and who were her fellow travelers?  On the other hand, however, 
                Gladys’s letters inspire a curiosity about the place itself: how would a traveler—any traveler—have imagined the Pacific Northwest in 1909?  Given the centrality of the American west to the ethos of American exceptionalism, and the powerful myths of 
                the frontier that shaped American thought so profoundly throughout the nineteenth century, what cultural and political forces would have been at work in 1909 to shape a tourist’s experience of an increasingly modernized frontier?</p>
              <p>It seems important at this point to give a brief account of the ways that people experienced greater mobility in a new region— the ways that the west became more accessible physically to new groups of tourists in Gladys’s time. Perhaps the most 
                important railroad presence in the region, The Union Pacific Railroad would connect the essentially "foreign" country of the Pacific Northwest to the well-developed urban east.  United with the Central Pacific line in Utah in 1869, the Union Pacific 
                Railroad not only achieved the distinction of becoming the first transcontinental railroad in the United States, but heralded itself as a symbol of national unification and patriotic spirit in tense post-war years.  Thwarted by the tough terrain of 
                the Rocky Mountains, sectional tensions among its converging routes, and attacks from the Native American tribes who were displaced by railroad construction, the process toward completion was arduous.  However, the Union Pacific ultimately made it 
                possible to travel from New York City to San Francisco in only ten days.  By the final years of the nineteenth century, it had become not only a vehicle for freight, but for people, and a new era of tourism began in the American west.  When the Union 
                Pacific faced bankruptcy in 1897, railroad baron E.H. Harriman purchased the company, and in 1901 he initiated a series of aggressive infrastructural improvements to the Overland Route, the principal passenger train line.  With hundreds of new miles 
                of double track and shortened routes, the Union Pacific was restored to prominence and profitability.  Although Gladys does not explicitly mention that she traveled west by rail, it is a reasonable assumption; a cross-country trip in an automobile 
                would have been unlikely (and daring) in 1909.  As we try to imagine the world in which Gladys lived and the means by which she moved through it, these climactic years for the railroad industry offer a compelling context in which to place her.  
                She was traveling in the west at a time when people could travel vast distances with speed, safety, and perhaps for the first time ever, in comfort<bibl><ref target="#UnionPacific"></ref>n.p.</bibl>.</p>
              <p>However, of equal importance is the way that the west was opened imaginatively to tourists at the turn of the century.  The very railroad companies that made it possible for new groups of Americans to see the west for themselves also played 
                an incredibly prominent role in the perpetuation of a certain image of the American west.  Of principal interest are the See America First campaign launched by civic leaders in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wonderland series issued by the Northern 
                Pacific Railroad from 1883 to 1906.  <bibl><ref target="#CS">27</ref></bibl>The See America First advertising campaign began simply as a slogan created by Fisher Sanford Harris, a passionate community advocate and local politician in Salt Lake City.  Eventually, his slogan became the most 
                recognizable creed of the national parks in America.  Citizens interested in
                developing a thriving tourist industry in the west “used See America First not simply as a booster slogan to promote the idea of a cooperative tourist organization .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. but 
                more broadly as an expression of western regionalism in response to the centralizing forces that were reconfiguring the emerging urban industrial nation-state” <bibl><ref target="#MS">Shaffer 560</ref></bibl>.  “See America First” went from being a headline in the Salt Lake Telegram 
                in 1905, to the proper designation for a league of delegates and fundraisers devoted to promoting tourism in the west, and eventually could be found on every billboard advertising the Great Northern Railway.</p>
              <p>See America First was intimately connected to the spirit of American exceptionalism.  “Nationalist Americans,” Marguerite Shaffer writes, “looked to the American landscape with its abundant national resources and magnificent scenery to compensate 
                for America’s lack of an ancient past.  Scenic and sublime wilderness in America
                offered a natural legacy representative of American .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. superiority over Europe”<bibl><ref target="#MS">565</ref></bibl>.  Harris’s brainchild was originally conceived as a means of interesting American 
                middle-class and upper-class citizens in domestic travel; countless American dollars were being spent by an emergent leisure class on sightseeing in Europe, and westerners believed that the American frontier was the answer to the problem.  In similar 
                fashion, and perhaps broader in cultural scope, was the Northern Pacific Railroad’s “Wonderland” series.  Borrowing from the title of Lewis Carroll’s popular book, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company issued a volume each year between 1883 and 1906 
                that featured various attractions of the Pacific Northwest.  Some of the issues were devoted specifically to different Pacific Northwest localities, like Yellowstone Park or the Inland Passage in Alaska.  Others treated the region traversed by the 
                railroad as a whole.  The booklets included propagandistic descriptions of the landscape and vivid illustrations designed to lure travelers to ride its rails<bibl><ref target="#RRseries">n.p.</ref></bibl>.  It is difficult to imagine that, somewhere along her journey, Gladys would not have seen 
                one of the See America First billboards, or that she grew up in a literate middle-class family without ever leafing through one of the Wonderland books that would have certainly captured the imagination of an independent young woman.</p>
              <p>Also important to our understanding of Gladys’s cultural perspective, with respect to the presence of railroads, is our understanding of the effect they had on defining a region.  Because of railroads, the Pacific Northwest became the next entrepreneurial 
                endeavor of America’s modern economy.  However, John M. Findlay notes that “the
                railroad companies’ efforts to create a distinct regional identity may have counted for more.  To be profitable in the Northwest, they needed to attract [people] .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. 
                to ride their trains .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. the companies launched continual publicity campaigns to sell Oregon, Idaho, and Washington as a single region called ‘the Great Northwest’”<bibl><ref target="#JF">Shaffer 51</ref></bibl>. </p>
              
              <p><hi rend="bold">The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 and Destination Travel
                to Yellowstone Park</hi>. Like many World's Fair expositions at the turn of the century, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 (AYP) was a destination to 
                which many people would travel vast distances. As mentioned above, Gladys (originally from Massachusetts) 
                likely travelled west to the AYP Exposition by rail. Glady’s visit to Yellowstone Park en route to the fair 
                suggests that she rode the Northern Pacific Railroad, which actively advertised its sleeper car service from 
                St. Louis to Yellowstone as an en-route destination to the AYP Exposition.  Visitors could lay over at 
                Yellowstone Park as part of a Seattle-bound itinerary for no additional charge from the Northern Pacific 
                railroad. During their visit to Yellowstone, an elaborate set of stagecoach routes and resort-style hotels 
                ensured that well-off visitors could spend days sightseeing the park in comfort and style <bibl><ref target="#NorthernPacific">37-40</ref></bibl>.  Thus, in her 
                travels to the AYP Exposition, Gladys travelled through an idealized American West that was largely 
                constructed by the emergent tourist industry; the version of Yellowstone Park that she encounters is 
                almost as intricately engineered and maintained as the AYP Exposition itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Although the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (AYP) Exposition of 1909 was particularly focused on promoting commerce 
                  and tourism in the Pacific Northwest, it can and should be contextualized in terms of a larger Exposition 
                  culture in America and around the world.  The fair takes place 58 years after the first such event, The Great Exhibition in 
                  Hyde Park, London in 1851, and 56 years after the first American Exposition held in New York City in 1853.  
                  Like many American expositions, the AYP was originally conceived as a commemoration of an American historical event.
                  The 1876 Centennial Exposition commemorated the Declaration of Independence; the Chicago World’s Fair 
                  commemorated the arrival of Columbus in America; the 1904 St. Louis Exposition commemorated the Louisiana 
                  Purchase; and the 1905 Portland Exposition commemorated the westward journey of Lewis and Clark <bibl><ref target="#NorthernPacific">6</ref></bibl>. 
                  Indeed, this larger exposition culture ultimately affected the AYP’s reimagining from a 1907 celebration of the 
                  1897 Klondike Gold Rush to a 1909 celebration of Pacific Northwest commerce and tourism; the AYP Exposition 
                  was moved from 1907 to 1909 partly to avoid conflict with the 1907 World’s Fair in Norfolk, Virginia that 
                  commemorated the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement.<bibl><ref target="#OReillyAYP">9</ref></bibl> 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a Northern Pacific Railroad brochure advertising the AYP shows, the exposition ultimately downplayed its 
                  relationship to the Klondike Gold Rush:
                  <quote type="block">
                    <lb/>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition is based upon no historical incident.  
                    <lb/>It is simply and frankly a broad, commercial proposition, but it will be 
                    <lb/>just as full and complete, just as educative and valuable and satisfying 
                    <lb/>as if it commemorated the most profoundly impressive event in our national
                    <lb/>history. <bibl><ref target="#NorthernPacific">6</ref></bibl>
                  </quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether Gladys had been to any other World’s Fair expositions is unknown, but Gladys suggests in her 
                  letters that at least some of her upper-class travel companions have been to other expositions.  
                  Nonetheless, with an estimated attendance of 3.7 million people, the AYP Exposition undoubtedly attracted 
                  a range of visitors from many walks of life and socioeconomic classes.  Advertisements for the exposition 
                  corroborate this range of attendees: for example, 1909 Northern Pacific Railroad pamphlet reminds readers 
                  that they can contact the Exposition’s travel bureau by mail regarding the size of their travel party and 
                  their budget, and in exchange, the travel bureau will “return a list of addresses of the class of 
                  accommodations required” <bibl><ref target="#NorthernPacific">27</ref></bibl>.
                </p>
                <p>The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition was constructed on 250 acres on the grounds of the University of 
                  Washington and was located approximately 20 minutes’ ride by streetcar from downtown Seattle.  
                  The University of Washington had struggled to expand at the same rate as Seattle’s fast-growing population, 
                  and although many of the AYP buildings were designed to be temporary, the University of Washington claimed 
                  and used many AYP buildings after the fair’s conclusion.  Most of the elaborate landscaping originally designed by John Olmsted has been built over in the subsequent century, 
                  but the University of Washington campus continues to bear the overall layout of the AYP 
                  Exposition grounds.  For example, the main thoroughfare of Rainier Avenue continues to bisect the campus and point 
                  to the iconic Mount Rainier; each side of the fairgrounds is still bordered by scenic man-made lakes <bibl><ref target="#UWash">n.p.</ref></bibl>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some regards, the AYP Exposition was a typical American World’s Fair: like many other such fairs, it had a busy midway
                  (called the “Pay Streak”) that included side shows, fair rides such as a roller coaster and ferris wheel, 
                  dancing, food, and risqué sideshows. A number of travelling exhibits common to other World’s Fairs reappeared 
                  at the AYP Exposition, including an exhibit of baby incubators for infants born as early as 6 to 7 months’ 
                  gestation; buildings and exhibits finances by other states who wished to promote their industries 
                  (Pennsylvania, for example, financed a mining exhibit); buildings extravagantly designed in a wide range of 
                  architectural styles; and brilliant electric displays that illuminated the fair until midnight each night <bibl><ref target="#AYPFilm">n.p.</ref></bibl>.  
                  In other regards, however, the AYP was unique among World’s Fair Expositions.  The AYP's strong focus on the Pacific Northwest 
                  region’s commerce and industry influenced many of its exhibits, including the Forestry Building that Gladys 
                  describes in detail in her letter from July 10th.  The Northern Pacific Railroad’s promotional pamphlet for the fair states the AYP Exposition’s goals:
                 </p>
                  <quote type="block">
                  FIRST: To exploit the resources and potentialities of the Alaska and Yukon territories in the United States 
                    and the Dominion of Canada.
                  SECOND: To make known and foster the vast importance of the trade of the Pacific Ocean and of the countries 
                    bordering thereon.
                  THIRD: To demonstrate the marvelous progress of Western America, where, within a radius of 1,000 miles of 
                    Seattle, 7,500,000 persons live who are directly interested in making the exposition the true exponent of 
                    their material wealth and development. <bibl><ref target="#NorthernPacific">5</ref></bibl>
                  </quote>
              <p>
                  In accordance with these goals, Washington state’s major Pacific trade partner of Japan had a strong 
                  presence at the fair.  According to the documentary film <title level="m">Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition: Seattle’s Forgotten World’s Fair</title>, 
                  Ships from the Japanese Navy docked at Puget Sound, the Japanese tea house was a 
                  popular attraction with visitors, and Japanese dignitaries visited the fairgrounds.  The AYP was also a 
                  product of its unique historical moment: for example, the AYP was held just six years after the Wright 
                  Brothers’ historic first flight and airplanes were thus a popular exhibit item at the fair. The 
                  controversial win (and subsequent disqualification) of a Ford Model T in the AYP Exposition’s 
                  New-York-to-Seattle automobile race helped launch the popular Ford Model T in the American market (the vehicle made its debut approximately 9 months earlier in September 1908).  
                  Women’s suffrage activists from around the country converged on AYP Exposition to lobby for women’s right 
                  to vote, and perhaps partly because of their efforts, Washington State granted women’s suffrage the next 
                  year in 1910. Whereas many previous American Expositions had made most of their money selling alcohol, 
                  the AYP was a <q>“dry”</q> fair—partly because of its placement on the University of Washington Campus, which 
                  was dry by law.  Nonetheless, the AYP turned a financial profit and was considered a success in its own 
                  time <bibl><ref target="#AYPFilm">n.p.</ref></bibl>.

                <p>
                  In one of her letters, Gladys mentions a feature of turn-of-the-century Expositions that modern readers 
                  may find troubling: the display of what Gladys calls <q>“bare natives”</q> in exhibits such as the Hawaiian 
                  Building, the Igarotte Building, and the Eskimo Building.  Native peoples were often displayed at 
                  Expositions such as the AYP, sometimes taking the form of side-show-like displays in which visitors 
                  could view the natives engaged in leisure activities and sometimes in the form of active stage shows 
                  involving fights, sport displays, or simulated Cowboy-and-Indian battles.  These exhibits were explicitly 
                  part of a larger Western imperial project and were meant to show visitors that the native peoples that 
                  the Western powers colonized could benefit from the technological and social progress on display elsewhere 
                  on the Exposition grounds.  Recent historians, however, have suggested that the relationship between
                  native peoples and these exhibits is more complex and nuanced than it may at first appear: for example, 
                  the AYP’s Igarotte Building featured exhibits by the indigenous Igarotte hill people from the Phillippines, 
                  a troupe that appeared regularly at many World’s Fairs and were financially compensated for their 
                  performance through a hired business manager.  The AYP Fair Queen was an Inuit girl who had grown up 
                  appearing in Eskimo exhibits at World’s Fairs; in exchange for financial compensation, she and her 
                  family would pose for photographs in front of a plastic igloo at the Eskimo Building. In other words, 
                  some of the native peoples involved with American Exposition culture were consciously choosing to put 
                  themselves on display for profit, thereby gaining financial and social gain from a system that aimed to 
                  exploit and denigrate them <bibl><ref target="#AYPFilm">n.p.</ref></bibl>.
                </p>
              <p><hi rend="bold">Seattle, a Rapidly Expanding City</hi>. In 1909 the young Gladys Stephens made her way to Seattle as part of a series of destination 
                visited in anticipation of the 1909 World Fair, also known as the Alaska Yukon-Pacific Exposition,
                in Seattle.  But what sort of city was Gladys entering?  We see in her letters mentions of her 
                life in Seattle and all it entailed, but scant detail is paid to the city itself, its history, 
                and the peculiar time in which she visited.  Seattle during this period had grown continuously 
                backed by the latest and last Gold Rush in the United States, the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-1898 
                described at length by Lisa Mighetto and Marcia Montgomery in <title level="m">Hard Drive to the Klondike</title>.
                The Klondike Gold Rush was itself in Alaska, however Seattle’s position in the extreme northwest of the 
                continental United States and previously developed port on Puget Sound made it invaluable as a transition 
                point for those moving to Alaska to mine, and those returning with or without gold.  As a result of the 
                Gold Rush Seattle became a hotbed for a number of industries supporting the influx of males looking to 
                strike it rich.  This included a burgeoning saloon industry, illegal gambling interests and businessmen 
                promoting prostitution and later pornography as described by Richard C. Berner in <title level="m">Seattle 1900-1920: From Boomtown
                  , Urban Turbulence, to Restoration.</title><bibl><ref target="Berner">5</ref></bibl>  Approximately 100,000 miners were attracted by 
                the Gold Rush, and some 70,000 of them passed through Seattle, nearly doubling the previous population 
                of the city.<bibl><ref target="Mighetto">17</ref></bibl>  By the end of the next decade the influx of population and gold had led 
                to a rapid increase in the boundaries of the city itself as wide swaths of land to the south of Elliott

                In Seattle Gladys would have found a bevy of men, a boisterous nightlife, and a city in the process of 
                transforming itself.  Although Seattle continued to be a coal and wood-burning city during this period 
                beautification became a significant priority, leading to the creation of a comprehensive park plan for 
                the city, developed by the Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts. <bibl><ref target="Berner">104</ref></bibl>  The park system 
                developed piecemeal while focusing on the acquisition of land focused on tracts with views of the water, 
                mountains and woodlands.  This park system would have constituted the primary means for Gladys Stephens 
                to move about the city as the parks were connected by parkways, which became bridle paths for the horse 
                set and for carriages, boulevards. <bibl><ref target="Berner">105</ref></bibl>  In addition to movement about the city, Gladys was 
                quite interested in the World’s Fair, and would have been a frequent visitor to the Fair on its site 
                amidst the new campus of the University of Washington.  The University, originally located downtown had 
                moved its campus to the shore of Lake Washington, just east of Union Bay, in 1894.  Its new site was on 
                the periphery of the city proper, meaning that construction efforts involved clearing forest, supplying 
                utilities and so forth.<bibl><ref target="Berner">82</ref></bibl>  It was the Exposition itself that came to be the means of a 
                continual increase in the University’s capabilities and reputation as its selection as the site of the 
                Exposition in 1906 funneled funds into such departments as the forestry, journalism, domestic science 
                during a time when the Washington state legislature resisted financing the continued construction.
                <bibl><ref target="Berner">84-85</ref></bibl>  In the midst of great economic and social development Gladys Stephens encountered a 
                city as much in the growing stages of its life and she herself was.  Neither fully formed, both still 
                vibrant and ever-changing, Seattle proved to be a powerful site motivating frequent correspondence with 
                Gladys’ circle of family and acquaintances, correspondence that led to the collection of the Stephens 
                Family Letters today.

                Within the selected letters presented here, McIntyre never explicitly mentions the potential dangers of his work, 
                but the wreck of the S.S. Ohio informs some of his remarks about various ships. In his September 13 letter, 
                he mentions an acquaintance who was the "Chief from the S.S. Ohio." We do not know if McIntyre ever served on the Ohio, 
                but it had just wrecked on a reef off the coast of Alaska a few weeks earlier, killing five people 
                <bibl><ref target="#WSO">"Wreck of the Steamship Ohio" 14</ref></bibl>. McIntyre himself would have been involved 
                with getting some of the surviving passengers to their original destination, had he not transferred from the Santa Clara to 
                the Northwestern when he did. His August 13 letter describes the transfer, the Ohio wrecked on August 26, and the Santa Clara 
                left port with passengers from the Ohio on August 30 <bibl><ref target="#SPPOR">"Steamer Portland"</ref></bibl>. 
                The contemporary account even mentions that the Santa Clara's next stop would be in Juneau to pick up survivors from 
                another shipwreck, that of the steamer Humboldt.
              </p>
              <p>
                The contemporary article that mentions the Santa Clara also holds interest for a reader of McIntyre's letters because it sheds 
                some light on the activities of the ships on which he served. Before the Santa Clara had been dispatched to help out the 
                survivors of the Ohio, it had been "idle for three months" <bibl><ref target="#SPPOR">"Steamer Portland"</ref></bibl>. Thus, 
                when McIntyre refers to the Santa Clara as a "mail boat" in his August 13 letter, we can infer that it was not actively engaged 
                in shipping mail when he wrote the letter. The Santa Clara may have had a contract with the Post Office at the time, but its idleness 
                helps explain why McIntyre ends that same letter with the word "lightboat." If the Santa Clara were serving as a lightboat, or lightship, 
                during those months of inactivity, then it was helping to keep the coast safe by operating as a kind of lighthouse upon the water. 
                Such an operation must have been subsidized by the government, but it begs questions about how much money the crew and the steamship company 
                made for such services. These circumstances also highlight the numerous purposes of the merchant marine during this time. The state of U. S. 
                shipping required steamship companies to come up with various and wide-ranging modes of income. 
              </p>
              <p>
                McIntyre indicates that his ships are involved in the freight business, especially with the rapidly 
                expanding canning and salmon industries. In <title level="m">The American Year Book</title> of 
                1910, Emory R. Johnson and G. G. Huebner explain that <q>[t]he American merchant marine engaged 
                in the coastwise and inland trade trade has increased for many years, while that engaged in the 
                foreign trade has gradually declined.</q> The Atlantic and Gulf region saw more than three times 
                the steam vessels than the Pacific coast, however, and steam vessels in the Northern lakes region 
                carried approximately 63% more freight tonnage than those on the Pacific coast <bibl><ref target="#AYB1910">522</ref></bibl>. 
                Furthermore, between 1908 and 1909 the number and tonnage of ships constructed on the Pacific coast decreased 
                by 23% and 60%, respectively <bibl><ref target="#AYB1910">524</ref></bibl>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond commerce, the steam vessels in the Pacific Northwest also carried tourists to Alaskan destinations. 
                <title level="m">A Trip to Wonderful Alaska</title>, a promotional travel guide published by the Alaska Steamship 
                Company, boasts that <q>the cruise along the Southeastern coast of Alaska is by far the more picturesque</q> 
                than <q>the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence,</q> and that <q>the voyage to the North is more instructive 
                than a tour of the Old World and the scenery which the tourist beholds surpasses the Alps of Switzerland 
                in its mighty and rugged grandeur.</q> McIntyre hikes to the lower and upper waterfalls of the Ketchikan 
                River with Irene Palmer, the sister of the <name type="ship">Northwestern</name>'s purser, and Gladys 
                Stephens, and he writes to Gladys of the forthcoming totem park at Klawock. Alaskan Indian culture was quickly 
                becoming a featured tourist attraction, driven by a perceived enervation of traditional cultures and the 
                preservation efforts to counteract that enervation which, ironically, was a product of American intrusion.

                JJ McIntyre's letter on Sep. 13, 1909, details the cargo freighted on the Black Ball Line 
                from Alaska back to the lower 48 states. In that freight is 126 heads of cattle and 3 mules,
                which at first appears to be  necessary livestock for the establishment of colonies in Alaska.
                Interestingly, this freight is onboard at the same time as 3000 cases of salmon. The former 
                seem to be supplies brought northward from the lower 48 to service the Alaskan outposts, the latter seem
                to be freight brought southward to bring the frontier's bounty back to serve a growing nation.
                In fact, McIntyre's described trajectory from Ketchikan to Taku and onward to Chilkoot, Gypsum, Sitka, and 
                Belling Run is a loop that moves generally southward on the second leg. So, at times, the ship 
                would normally have freight for both the northern and southern ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of this is to indicate the intensive co-dependent relationship of northern and southern markets. 
                Rene De La Pedraja writes that the northern and southern ends of the Alaska route were conventionally 
                divided by two local monopolies: the Alaska Steamship Company and the Alaska Coast Company<bibl><ref target="#DLP">10</ref></bibl>. But in 1914,
                after the time of these letters, the Alaska Coast Company became the Admiral Line, which was destroyed in 1933
                by competition with the Alaska Steamship Company <bibl><ref target="#DLP">11</ref></bibl>. The Alaska Steamship
                Company had incurred traditionally in the Alaska Coast Company's territory when its ships were idle due to 
                the seasonal nature of Alaskan shipping. Pacific-borne freight in the early 20th century often suffered from a trade imbalance, which very 
                physically impacted shipping routes. De La Pedraja notes <bibl><ref target="#DLP">175</ref></bibl>
                the Dollar shipping company resolved its freight imbalance by shipping Chinese passengers in freight
                and skirting the law by flying the British flag. After having dominated Alaska-based freight, the Alaska Shipping 
                Company handled 85% of south-bound cargoes, imposing high prices on its primary customers, salmon canneries <bibl><ref target="#DLP">11</ref></bibl>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This anecdote indicates the troubled relationship between the law and inter-territorial traffic, from the lower 48
                to Alaska. At the height of the Progressive Era, the Federal Government struggled with regulating inter-territorial commerce
                and its now-threatened natural resources. Since the beginning of salmon fishing in Alaska, fishers recognized the threat
                of depletion <bibl><ref target="#PR">3</ref></bibl>. The obvious solution to this problem at the time was to found salmon 
                hatcheries in Alaska, invented in 1763 in Germany and first practiced in the United States in 1866<bibl><ref target="#PR">3</ref></bibl>. 
                But quickly, hatcheries and canneries had to account for the continued ecological collapse. Because fishers continued 
                to deplete salmon runs at the same time that hatcheries were running, these two methods were viewed as complements rather than supplements: 
                in the words of Patricia Roppel, <q>Why stop fishing when a hatchery would in theory replenish the runs?</q><bibl><ref target="#PR">5-6</ref></bibl>.
                Over time, the multiple bodies involved--fishers, hatchers, canners, and politicians--all proposed different solutions to 
                depletion. As of the 1900 revision of the 1899 fisheries act, all persons removing salmon from Alaskan waters
                were required to establish a hatchery that produced at least four sockeye fry, which are today called sac-fry or alevin, for every
                salmon removed <bibl><ref target="#PR">9</ref></bibl>. Unfortunately, because the cannery buildings were <q>often on sites where
                  water was of poor uqality and quantity, where insufficient numbers of salmon returned to provide eggs for incubation, or where 
                  high water destroyed the structures</q> <bibl><ref target="#PR">9</ref></bibl>, the law became even more convoluted in response.
                After a 1902 bill on salmon culture, the US federal government took possession of all water and fish in Alaskan streams
                and extending 4 miles into the tidewater: the Treasury leased the product of the home stream to fishermen, while natives were allowed to 
                fish for food, not commerce, from the streams <bibl><ref target="#PR">12</ref></bibl>. But all of this was overturned again in 1906,
                with a bill that superseded the act of 1899 and instead provided a tax-and-rebate system to promote private hatcheries. All salmon
                canned in Alaska were levied four cents a case, while hatcheries received a rebate of forty cents for every ten cases of salmon fry
                released <bibl><ref target="#PR">15</ref></bibl>. The combined effect of this was that salmon companies would only incur levies 
                by an estimation error, that is, if they managed to miscalculate how many salmon they would catch and produce. The Alaska Packers
                Association in 1907 canned 806,808 cases of salmon but only paid 32 cents in taxes, which they paid with stamps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clearly, by the time that JJ McIntyre loaded 3000 cases of salmon onto the Black Ball Line, salmon was a colonial enterprise
                dedicated to extracting the maximum of resources from the Alaskan territory for the longest possible time. Assuming that the people 
                who removed 3000 cases of salmon from Alaska had not offset their levies with rebates, the cases on McIntyre's boat were only taxed
                120 dollars in sum, or about 2744 dollars in today's money <bibl><ref target="#USLab">CPI Inflation Calculator</ref></bibl>. The ghostly 
                presence of native fishers in Congressional law is the exemption that proves the rule: the government of the colonialists only feels the need to 
                makepassing reference to the original fishers. It goes without saying that Roppel's book contains no mention of compensation or reparation,
                and the index doesn't even make any mention of natives or Indians.
              </p>
              <p>
                JJ McIntyre's perspective is predicated on the US imperial naval position in the early 20th century. In his same letter on September 13,
                he references China, Japan, and Manila, all of which had some kind of colonial relationship with the US. Under the Treaty of Paris, the 
                United States purchased the islands from Spain. Whether JJ McIntyre was present in East Asia as a member of the US Navy cannot be known, 
                but even if he was part of the Merchant Marine, his travels still represent a period of outright economic colonialism.

              <p><hi rend="bold">The Decline of the U.S. Merchant Marine at the Turn of the
                Century</hi>. Contemporary sources trace the decline of the merchant marine back to the American Civel War and its aftermath. 
                In an issue of The American Marine Engineer from 1915, an article titled 
                "The American Merchant Marine" significantly quotes secretary McCulloch to 
                help explain the waning U. S. shipping industry (despite the fact that McCulloch 
                served under President Lincoln, and the last time he had held that position was 1885). 
                According to the anonymously written article, McCulloch blamed various domestic policies 
                as well as tariffs for status of U. S. shipping: 
                <quote>The decline of American shipping commenced with the substitution of iron for wooden ships. 
                  It was hastened by our refusal to permit our shipowners to protect their ships by a foreign flag 
                  during the war, by the tempting opportunities of railroad development: the finishing blow being given to 
                  it by a tariff which by taxing the materials that are used in the construction of ships, made them too costly to invite 
                  capital in that direction and forced it into manufactures.</quote> These conditions directly and indirectly 
                resulted from the Civil War, and they continued to plage the merchant marine for half a century. 
                The article goes on to explain that in 1850, 75% of maritime shipping in the U. S. was done by American ships, but by 1864, 
                the figure plummeted to 27%. By 1896, it was down to 11%, and by 1914, it reached a low of 8.6% <title level="a">The American Merchant Marine</title>. 
                The impact of World War I on European shipping allowed for a resurgence in the U. S. merchant marine; however, when J. J. McIntyre 
                is writing about his life as a merchant marine in 1909, the industry had reached an unprecedented low point. 
              </p>
              <p>Congress attempted to mitigate the decline of the merchant marine with the passage of the Ocean Mail Act of 1891, otherwise known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1891. 
                Congress had already taken previous actions to subsidize individual steamship companies; however, as Rene De La Pedraja notes, 
                this was "the first general subsidy bill passed by Congress since the pre-Civil War period" <bibl><ref target="#RDLP">452</ref></bibl>. The act 
                positioned the Post Office to consider bids and renewals for five and ten year contracts, which, as De La Pedraja observes, 
                "halted but did not reverse the downward trend in the U.S. merchant marine" <bibl><ref target="#RDLP">452</ref></bibl>. Ships built in the United States were quite 
                expensive at the time, so the act only benefitted the larger, more established steamship companies. Also, the subsidies 
                themselves were apparently only moderately enticing because, of the fifty-three mail routes that the Post Office sought bids for, 
                they received only eleven proposals <bibl><ref target="#RDLP">De La Pedraja 452</ref></bibl>. Nonetheless, by the turn of the century, private companies in the 
                merchant marine were shipping mail across both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Thus, when J. J. McIntyre refers to the 
                Santa Clara as a "mail boat" in his letter from August 13, he underscores one of the primary functions of the merchant marine 
                at the time.

                Of interest to diverse readers will be the curious love affair between James J. McIntyre and Gladys Stephens. 
                In fact, upon reading McIntyre's letters, one must wonder how James McIntyre, a crewmember on the S.S. Northwestern 
                and Gladys Stephens, a lady of some means and social mobility, could have ever met and fallen in love. McIntyre’s 
                correspondence with Stephens does not provide much information regarding how the two met or indeed, 
                how their very different lives ever crossed paths.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="GSandJJMmeeting"/><note resp="ed" xml:id="GSandJJMmeeting"> Given that 
                  they both seem to have lived in <placeName ref="#Seattle">Seattle</placeName> and refer to it often, it is possible that Stephens and McIntyre met there. However, this is not confirmed in their 
                  correspondence.</note> However, based on the collection of letters that we have, 
                it is certain that McIntyre feels passionately about his “little girl” Gladys and he tells her this numerous 
                times in his love letters. At the center of their romance is a budding intrigue—McIntyre often mentions his 
                concern that Stephens’s family will disapprove of him and of their relationship. The man is clearly conscious of 
                a great disparity in their social stations and thus an overwhelming sense of his own inadequacy preoccupies McIntyre 
                in his writings. As a crewmember on a ship, McIntyre worries that he will be perceived as a man of low class and that 
                he will be judged harshly according to contemporary stereotypes about sailors. Indeed, in his August 23rd, 1909 letter 
                to Stephens, he attempts to prepare his love for the harsh judgments that she may face: 
              </p>
              <p>
                <q>one off the many things that you will be told is this honey He’s only a seafaring man. And I will admit that their Rep. 
                  is none too good but that comes more from the sailor class on war ships and sailing vessles and all deap water crafts 
                  mostly foreigners and dear I hope too be through with this in the near future...</q>
              </p>
              <p>
                McIntyre’s explanation of the distinctions among the different types of ship crewmen provides us with a fascinating window 
                into both the man’s concept of himself and also the complex social strata for laborers on merchant ships. Indeed, Anglo-American 
                historians have often advanced the notion that social relations on ships were harmonious in spite of differences in rank and file 
                among the ship's crew. However, around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, social 
                stratification among the different workers was evident. In fact, the workforce of the steamship now consisted of three different 
                crews, which were the sailors on deck, the firemen below stoking the steam boilers, and in the passenger lines, the stewards in the 
                catering and housekeeping sectors<bibl><ref target="#MaritimeRace">178</ref></bibl>. Since McIntyre was most likely a tramp engineer 
                (a form of unsteady employment that required few skills, and was poorly paid), he probably would have belonged to the stoking crew, 
                which was widely regarded as the lowest rank of unskilled labor<bibl><ref target="#MaritimeRace">179</ref></bibl>. This crew and all 
                other nontraditional forms of steamship employment in the early 1900s suffered significant disparagement from the sailors on deck, who 
                considered themselves as the only true sailors left. McIntyre's desire to differentiate himself from other sailors and their bad reputations 
                is interesting from a critical perspective. It may indicate the man's sensitivity regarding his low station on the ship and his desire to elevate himself 
                above other crewmembers that likely discriminate against him. 
                
              </p>
              <p>
                His desire to set himself apart from other seafaring men suggests that McIntyre is attempting to carve an identity for himself 
                apart from his profession — or at the very least, that he is trying to convince Stephens that he is different from other men in his position. 
                In his attempt to distance himself from the lot, however, McIntyre more often follows expected behaviors for sailors in the late 
                nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. David Cordingly reminds us that sailors’ writing homesick letters to their wives and 
                girlfriends was a typical activity for men working on merchant ships. As he remarks, <q>“sailors spent, and no doubt still do spend, 
                  a great deal of time thinking of women…and above all they wrote letters to their women. These letters are often heartrending to 
                  read and show that the happy-go-lucky sailor was often desperately homesick and wanted nothing more than for the voyage to end so 
                  he could return to his loved ones at home” </q> <bibl><ref target="#SeafarWom">xiii</ref></bibl>. Perhaps unfortunately for McIntyre, therefore, his expressions of love and 
                desire for his Gladys may have come across as mere 'sailor talk' to his best girl at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                While McIntyre’s anxiety may at times seem more indicative of his own insecurities than of stringent social realities, it may also 
                be justified. In his August 23rd letter, McIntyre inquires whether Gladys has told her mother about their relationship. The clear 
                concern with which he inquires about this matter suggests that he anticipates a disastrous outcome to the revelation of their love 
                that will surely become an obstacle in their relationship. Yet, most telling of the blatant difference in their positions is the fact 
                that Stephens remains suspiciously quite about her relationship with McIntyre. Not only does she seem to correspond with McIntyre less 
                often than he writes to her—which could mean that she does not share his strong feeling of love—but she also makes no mention of him at all 
                in her letters to her relatives. In fact, while she reports writing to several friends and relatives while on her travels, we do not 
                have any such first-hand accounts of Stephens’s ineractions with and feelings for McIntyre.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, Stephens’s possible unconcern for McIntyre is largely speculative because we do not have her letters to McIntyre and thus 
                we cannot be sure about how many times she wrote to him (or what she might have said in those letters). We can glean from McIntyre’s letters 
                that he is a bit frustrated by his not receiving any letters from his “dear” Gladys, but he does not reveal whether this is because of his 
                traveling from port to port on numerous different ships – or if in fact he suspects that his “neddy” is snubbing him. The apprehension that 
                he sometimes betrays in his writing is certainly understandable: Numerous contemporary sources describe the unfavorable reputation of sailors 
                and other ship crewmen. These describe this class of men as swarthy, crass, uneducated and unfaithful. In fact, by the early nineteenth century, 
                the warning that <q>a sailor has a wife in every port</q> was a well-worn saying <bibl><ref target="#SeafarWom">xiii</ref></bibl>. Gladys is likely aware of these stereotypes about sailors, whose 
                reputation is “none too good,” and her apparent silence may be an indication of her hesitation to pursue the relationship. Nonetheless, the letters 
                from James McIntyre to Gladys Stephens provide a fascinating glimpse into what might have once been a steamy love affair between two individuals of 
                highly different social stations – and it is likely to raise a few eyebrows.

              <p><hi rend="bold">The Tramp Engineer</hi>.
                It's probable that McIntyre was a tramp engineer, a low-skill worker with little or no formal training 
                and who moves from job to job and company to company with little warning or loyalty. In his letter of 
                04 October 1909, he indicates that he has been a tramp engineer on five different ships that year. 
                Understandably, the tramp engineer drew criticism in the same way that low-skilled and unpredictable 
                workers still do, but he also had his champions. In the July 1907 issue of <title level="j">The American 
                Marine Engineer</title>, for example, a pseduonymous author declares that <q>it's the tramp experience 
                that teaches a man to do impossible things. It's the tramp engineer, a thousand miles from port, with a 
                monkey wrench, a cold chisel, a file, and a ratched brace that rebores a cylinder, puts in a new furnace 
                or does some other equally impossible stunt that the mail boat engineer would only dream of after a 
                welsh rarebit supper</q> <bibl><ref target="#AME1907">20</ref></bibl>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The itinterant and unprivileged nature of the position, though, were difficult to mask with braggartism, 
                and McIntyre seems to voice discontent when he writes that he has had enough changes for one year (04 October 
                1909). On the other hand, McIntyre did not sail internationally and therefore did not have to endure 
                the long absences from home that receive a sarcastic send-up in the May 1914 issue of <title level="j">The 
                Sailors' Magazine</title>: <q>[d]on't think that I am grumbling; sure not. Why, a little over three years 
                ago I saw my wife, and had the good fortune to be in her company for almost the whole of an hour</q> 
                <bibl><ref target="#SMJan1914">74</ref></bibl>. Regardless, the job was dangerous, and the tramp engineer 
                would likely be assigned the riskiest manual labor. McIntyre expresses that because the <name type="ship">Northwestern</name>'s 
                boilers have been acting up, it will be <q>a wonder</q> if no one is seriously injured (04 October 1909).
              </p>              
              <p><hi rend="bold">U.S. Perceptions of Mexico</hi>. Just as tourism between the Mississippi and Pacific shaped and reflected conceptions of America and the American 
                west, tourism and travel writing constructed a Mexico that validated the definition of the United States as a 
                benevolent, civilizing, superior force. Travelogues such as Mary Blake and Margaret Sullivan's 
                <title type="j">Mexico, Picturesque, Political, Progressive</title>, published in 1888, and T. Philip Terry's 
                <title type="j">Terry's Guides to Mexico</title>, first published in 1909, defined Mexico and Mexicans as either
                quaint and exotic or dangerous and degenerate. The travelogues frequently used descriptions of dress,
                to define Mexican identity. Gladys's descriptions of Mexico reflect the topics and attitudes of 
                these travelogues. Her observations about Mexican clothing as either exotic costume (when she describes the tight 
                pants and large hats of Mexican men) or a mark of uncivilized behavior (as in the case of the "peon women" who don't 
                wear corsets and the children who sometimes don't wear clothing) illustrates the fetishizing and denigrating 
                catigorization found in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century travelogues. Such attitudes also reflect the 
                inherent attitude of superiority in turn-of-the-century philosophies of Manifest Destiny and American expansion.
              </p>
              <p>For all that the United States professed a policy of splendid isolation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
                centuries, the United States the government rigorously pursued U.S. economic and political interests in Mexico and 
                Central and South America, at times supporting revolutionaries and regimes materially, financially, and politically. 
                This unofficial policy of political support for the United States' commercial interests abroad provided impetus for 
                the 1909 Taft-Diaz meeting in El Paso and La Ciudad Juarez. On October 16, 1909, President William Taft of the United 
                States and President Porfirio Diaz of Mexico met to discuss the political and economic relationship between the United 
                States and Mexico. Taft was particularly concerned that Diaz would continue his support of the United States' economic 
                interests in Mexico, as Mexico's civic unrest threatened to disturb the farms and businesses of the United States 
                within Mexico. In 1909, Diaz's position in Mexico was becoming increasingly unstable; in 1910, the country erupted in 
                revolution and civil war as multiple factions fought against Diaz and each other. In her letter to her mother dated 
                September 22, 1909, Gladys Stephens comments on the rising political unrest in Mexico and on her excitement for the 
                anticipated presidents' meeting. Gladys's presence in El Paso and Mexico approximately one month before Taft and Diaz 
                met places her accounts of the political situation in Mexico within the larger context of the relationship between the 
                United States and Mexico on the eve of the Mexican Revolution. Gladys's comments about the Rurales as necessary to keep 
                civic order and her statements that the rising civic unrest is directed against the fear of Reyes taking power rather 
                than Diaz's regime reflect the current favorable attitude of the United States towards Presiden Diaz.

            <bibl><ref target="#NYT1 #Koppy"></ref></bibl>Robert Dollar was the owner who renamed 
            the ship the James Dollar, and at that time it was chartered by Captain 
            Elmer E. Caine. Captain Caine later purchased the ship and, 
            according to an article in <title level="j">Pacific Merchant Marine</title>, <q>turned it over 
            to the Alaska-Pacific Navigation Company</q> (this is also when it was renamed the Santa Clara). 
            The Alaska-Pacific Navigation Company then sold it to the Northwestern Steamship Company, 
            which then merged with the Alaska Steamship Company. McIntyre was transferred from 
            the Santa Clara to the Northwestern in August 1909, and by November 6, 1909, 
            the Santa Clara had been sold again, this time to the North Pacific Steamship Company of 
            San Francisco. The article in the <title level="j">Pacific Merchant Marine</title> also offers a specific description of 
            the ship: <q>The Santa Clara is a wooden steamship, with modern 
            equipments, including the wireless telegraph, and is regarded as a good sailor. 
            She has comfortable passenger accommodations, and is a good cargo carrier. 
            She is 223 feet long, has a 38-foot beam, and a depth of 24-1 feet. 
            Her indicated horsepower is 900, and she carries a crew of 
            thirty-seven</q> <bibl><ref target="#SSCS"><title level="a">Steamer</title></ref></bibl>.</desc>

        <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
          previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
          and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
          include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries,
          30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to her
          sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," 
          by Samuel Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal
          of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
        
        <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
          on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
          English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
          opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
          cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
          databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
          what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
          represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
          reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
          students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell us
          about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
        
        <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
          explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
          the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
          and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
          that shape particular interpretations and presentations texts; and the mediation of
          electronic delivery systems.</p>
        
        <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
          need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing or
          the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
          the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
          Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
          broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
          example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
          historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
          case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
          need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
          archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
          matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
          the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
          original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
          the source texts.</p>
        
        <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
          representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access to
          manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with a
          variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
        
        <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat"><hi
              style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</hi></foreign>, the Stephens edition also
          explores ways of telling four stories inextricably woven into our work: the lives and
          historical milieu evoked by the texts, the history of the physical documents, the
          editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the texts, and the
          mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>
        
        <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
          the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
          consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
          structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
          repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
          However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
          revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>
          <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
          at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
          quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
          preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
          produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
          Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
          provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
        </p>
        
        <p><emph rend="bold">Transcription</emph>. Editing of the Stephens letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
          abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions above and below
          the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
          have all been transcribed and encoded as they appear in the original manuscripts. The
          representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of 
          the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link
          at the top of each view's page.</p>
        
        <p><emph rend="bold">Markup and Annotation</emph>. XML encoding of the Stephens letters follows The
          Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <title level="m">P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</title>,
          as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
          This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file
          using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded in HTML separately.
          A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu, and all source files
          (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
        
        <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists of people, places, ships, 
          and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main XML
          document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate appendices provide 
          further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and so on). 
          All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
        
        <p>
          <emph rend="bold">Proofing</emph>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
          transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation in The Ohio State University's 
          Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor Ulman.

            <note type="biographical">James J. McIntyre is a crewmember on the S.S. Northwestern. 
            He is enamoured with Gladys Stephens and writes to her often between the summer of 1909 and 
            the fall of 1909 (and probably later). It's likely that McIntyre was a tramp enginner, a low-ranking 
            crewman who switches jobs frequently and has little formal training. Between his letters of 13 August 
            1909 and 04 October 1909, McIntyre transfers from the <name type="ship">Santa Clara</name> to the 
            <name type="ship">Northwestern</name>, and in the latter letter, he indicates that in one calendar

              In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre identifies 
              Irene Palmer as the sister of the Purser on the S.S. Northwestern, and indicates 
              that she is 17 years old at the time of the letter. The 1900 U.S. Census records 
              that an Irene Palmer was born in September 1892 in Anderson Island, Washington, 
              which corroroborates her age in Macintyre's letter. The 1900 Census also shows 
              that Irene had two older brothers, which corroborates Macintyre's description of her 
              as the only girl in her family. The 1910 U.S. Census records Irene Palmer's city of

            <note type="biographical">
              In his letter to Gladys Stephens of 04 October 1909, James J. McIntyre speaks of spending 
              time with the S.S. Northwestern's purser's sister, whom he identifies as Irene Palmer. 
              Though McIntyre never mentions the purser by name, the 1900 U.S. Census shows that Irene 
              Palmer lived with two older brothers: Gilbert S. and Herbert E. Palmer. The 1910 Census 
              indicates that Gilbert S. Palmer was still a member of the family household, while Herbert 
              E. Palmer is not listed, suggesting that the purser of whom Macintyre speaks is Herbert E. 
              Palmer. In fact, a Herbert E. Palmer corresponding with the relevant genealogical data 
              does not appear at all on the 1910 Census, but this is not surprising if we consider that 
              the itinerant nature of his duties on the Northwestern could have prevented his being 
              recorded for the 1910 Census. It's likely that he didn't die during this gap, as a Herbert 
              E. Palmer matching the relevant genealogical data is recorded in the 1920 Census. At this 
              point, he had married Mary Palmer, a first generation Bohemian-American whose parents 
              emigrated from Bohemia, and the two lived in Pierce County, WA, which includes the greater 
              Tacoma area. The 1930 Census shows that Mary had died and Herbert had moved to Richmond, 
              NY, though it also incorrectly estimates his birth year as 1877. It's likely that even though 
              McIntyre refers to Herbert as Irene Palmer's brother, he was in fact her half-brother. 
              The 1930 Census indicates that both of Herbert's parents were born in Massachusetts, while 
              the head of the Palmer household, Gustavus Palmer, was born in Maine. Herbert's mother, 
              Minnie T. Palmer, was born in Massachusetts, and didn't marry Gustavus until 1882, 
              approximately 6 years after Herbert's birth

            In a letter dated July 14, 1909, Gladys describes travelling with a Virginian named Mrs. Hughes who is the cousin of Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor.  Mrs. Dana Gibson is likely a reference to Irene Langhorne, originally of Danville, Virginia.  She married graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson in 1895.  Charles Dana Gibson was the creator of the iconic Gibson Girl sketches.  Popular history suggests that Irene Langhorne (wife of Charles Dana Gibson) and her sister (Nancy Astor nee Langhorne, married to British politician Waldorf Astor) were the inspirations for the Gibson Girl.

"Mrs. Waldorf Astor" likely refers to Nancy Astor, wife of British Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton, Waldorf Astor.  Nancy Astor became the first female Member of Parliament when she succeeded her husband as MP for Plymouth Sutton in 1919; she served until 1945.  Along with her sister, Mrs. Dana Gibson (nee Irene Langhorne), Nancy Astor served as inspiration for the iconic Gibson Girl sketches penned by her brother in law, Charles Dana Gibson.

                Gladys Stephens describes a multi-day visit to Yellowstone Park where she drove a coach of four horses for 3 days. She mentions her travel companions "the Virginians" and "some Germans."  She describes the exhibits in the Forestry Building at the 1909 Seattle World's Fair. She describes the Forestry Building and comments that the Seattle World's Fair buildings will later be used by Seattle College.  She also remarks on Seattle, which she describes as looking "new" but having a number of 12- and 14-story buildings.

The Forestry Building is described in detail on the University of Washington Library's Special Collections web site as being <q>"sponsored by the State of Washington and was intended to showcase the state's forest resources. Architects Charles Saunders and George Lawton created a building that echoed the European style of Howard's buildings but which also incorporated the log-cabin idiom of early pioneer buildings. Featuring enormous unprocessed logs felled in Chehalis (now Gray's Harbor) County, the Forestry Building's grand colonnade and soaring interior spaces evoked the majesty of Washington's seemingly limitless forests and, not coincidentally, implied the great potential wealth they contained."</q>

                Gladys says that she is not going to Alaska because staterooms for the voyage are in such high demand.  She mentions telephoning the Goulds in Seattle, then talks about her travel companion Mrs. Hughes.  She particularly describes Mrs. Hughes' famous cousins Mrs. Dana Gibson and Mrs. Waldorf Astor as well as Mrs. Hughes' two sons and now-deceased husband.

                Gladys tells her mother of the group's return to Seattle; anticipates a visit to
                a wealthy Texan's ranch; makes ambiguous references to what we would assume is news or gossip 
                of friends and acquaintances from home; mentions correspondence with a few other individuals; 
                and brags about being shown around by Uncle Alex and the "plans for next summer" already in the works.

              <p>This original letter contains five loose sheets of cream-colored Hotel Georgian letterhead stationery
                measuring 6 x 9.5 inches. They have been folded in half and folded together.  The front side contains a 2.5-inch letterhead, a 6.75-inch
                body with blue lines spaced at .375-inch intervals, and a .25-inch bottom margin.
                The back side is unlined.  An oval watermark, variably placed on each sheet and measuring approximately
                2.375 x 2.625 inches when entirely visible, reads, in outline letters, "MERCHANTS |
                PRT'G CO | LURIE &amp; LURIE." The letterhead contains, in the upper left-hand
                corner, a 1.375 x 2.4375-inch image of the Hotel Georgian facade.  It should be noted that other letters
                in the collection, even as recently as the letters written by Gladys in July from the same hotel, are 
                likewise composed on Hotel Georgian stationery, but some time in the interim of Gladys's excursion to Alaska,
                the Hotel Georgian modified its stationery slightly.  The image is now an illustration rather than a photo, and depicts
                the hotel facade from a more diagonal angle (we see proportionally more of the side of the building. 
                The font of the letterhead has also changed (tending toward more of a block style than the slanted script)
                and minor additions have been made.  Near the top border of the paper, the hotel owner's names are printed
                ("D. Swinehart" and "Fred G. Caldwell"), and new qualifiers have been added under the "Hotel Georgian" moniker.
                The hotel stationery no longer includes a partially printed dateline ("Seattle, ________190____"), and so
                Gladys has handwritten the date ("8/8/.09") near the bottom, and slightly left of center, inside the
                bounded letterhead.  On subsequent pages, she numbers the pages by hand, again within the boundaries of the 
                letterhead, and in virtually the same place each time but not always in the same style (some page numbers are followed
                by periods, some by nothing, and one is underlined).</p>
              <accMat corresp="#GS19090808env">Accompanied by a stamped, cancelled, cream-colored envelope of Hotel Georgian stationery
                measuring 6.5 x 3.625 inches. A 1.375 x 2.4375-inch photographed image of the Hotel
                Georgian facade is printed on the left-hand side of the envelope above the hotel's
                address.  Incidentally, the image of the hotel on the envelope corresponds with the 
                image of the hotel facade on the outdated Hotel Georgian stationery.  The stamp is
                also upside down.</accMat>

              They provide customer service to guests; they also handle money on board, for both the ship's crew and its guests— which may have involved buying luxury goods on credit
              and bringing them aboard.  The Purser also helps guests with paperwork such as customs declarations.  Their duties are similar in definition to the ship's steward.  So, given that a Purser would be in charge of all manners
              of record-keeping, both personally and financially, for all people on board, it makes sense that Gladys would have obtained this kind of souvenir

            <lb/>sent her cards from <placeName>Yellowstone</placeName>

            mentions here are probably postcards from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific (A.Y.P.) exhibition.  A.Y.P. postcards, a large collection of which
            are housed in Special Collections at the University of Washington Libraries, feature various images from the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition
            in Seattle in 1909.  Although the Exposition did employ an official photographer for the event, amateur photographers
            were permitted to take unlimited photos of the event (with certain restrictions) and so several different individuals
            and publishers made and sold postcards at the Exposition.  Some of the postcards are in color (and so may have been manipulated) and others 
            are in black and white.  It is interesting that Gladys says the card she sends to her aunt from Seattle
            is made of leather; leather postcards were a popular novelty item in the first decade of the twentieth century, but were actually
            banned by the United States Postal Service in the year 1909- so Gladys may have been one of the last citizens
            to mail one.</note>

            stayed at the Hotel Georgian before and after the voyage north, and it is a familiar place to the group. The Hotel Georgian was, in fact, a 
            new hotel in Seattle when these visitors were staying there, built only one year before in 1908. It had seven floors and 
            108 rooms.<bibl><ref target="#RS"></ref>r</bibl></note>

                The letter describes certain details about McIntyre's life as a merchant marine, including his annual salary 
                and his transfer from the Santa Clara to the North Western.

              Since the French Revolution in the 1700's, male theatre dancers were considered effeminate.
              Though JJM is referring to dance as a social practice with his friends, we can see how the dominant culture would have found dancing
              in general as a gender specific female acivity. When men participated, it was alongside women through ballroom dancing. We 
              do not know if he only attended these gatherings with his male friends or if women would join their group, but in the following 
              lines of JJM's letter, he mentions that his mother would have long talks with him about being a <q>"better boy"</q>. He seems to be 
              referring to the idea that he would get into trouble after coming home from a party or dance.

                Writing from El Paso, Gladys evaluates Adelaide's wedding purchases 
                and fiance, as well as Gladys's experience with head lice, which she 
                picked up in Mexico. Gladys also explains to her mother that she is 
                staying in El Paso longer than she originally planned so she can 
                witness the Taft-Diaz meeting on October 16th, 1909. She briefly 
                explains the political tension in Mexico between President Diaz, 
                Vice-President Reyes, and the general populace. Though Gladys is 
                definitely writing from El Paso, her exact location within the city 
                is unknown. Her letter is on stationary from the Office of the Treasurer
                in Santa Cruz, California, but the postmark indicates she mailed the 
                letter from El Paso. In her letter, she mentions how her Uncle wants
                her to extend her stay in El Paso, which suggests she might be staying
                with him, but then she discusses her extensive time spent with Adelaide,
                which suggests she is staying with her.

              <p> ALS. Two loose sheets of cream-colored Office of the Treasurer, Santa Cruz County, California
                 letterhead stationary measuring 8.56 x 11 inches. The front of each sheet of letterhead contains
                 a 2.125 x 2 inch black and white image of a building in the upper left corner of the page and 
                 an image of flowers with a scroll bearing the words "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CALIFORNIA," along with
                 a medallion emblazoned with the words "Office of Treasurer." The combined image of the scroll, 
                 flowers, and medallion measures 2.125 x 4.25 inches. Underneath the image is text that reads 
                 "W.H. BIAS Treasurer" and "R.W. BIAS Deputy Treas.," followed by a line for the date partially
                 pre-printed as "________ / 1___." The edges of the paper are cleanly cut, though there is some
                 reddish-brown residue at the top of each sheet, which is possibly from an adhesive. The paper has 
                 light blue lines that extend to the ends of the sheet on the right and left sides and that are 
                 0.375 inches apart. On the front of each sheet there are 21 lines, the first one starting 3.063 inches
                 from the top of the sheet and the last one 0.1875 inches from the bottom of the sheet. On the 
                 back of the sheet the lines begin 1.125 inches from the top of the sheet and continue until 0.1875 inches
                 from the bottom. The lines are identical on the first and second sheets. Both sheets were placed 
                 together and then folded into thirds to fit into the envelope. The paper is thin, but not overly
                 fragile. There is a watermark in the lower half of each sheet that reads "AGAWAM BOND." When viewing 
                 the front of the sheet, the watermark is upside down and backwards.</p>

                  by a stamped, cancelled, dark cream-colored envelope made from heavy paper and measuring

                  of a log raft on the Columbia River. The text corrosponding with the image reads "LOG RAFT 
                  COLUMBIA RIVER 8 MILLION FT." The stamp is a red 2 cent Washington stamp and the postmark is
                  from El Paso, Texas. The envelope is addressed in a neat cursive script to "Mrs. A. T. Stephens, 
                  26 Emerson Street, Newton, Massachusets." There is an additional endorsement on the envelop in a different
                  hand than the written address of a circled 10, then a 9/25. The 25 is also circled. The envelope
                  is cleanly slit along the right edge.

              market dominated by South African production.  Considered fashionable, the feathers combined with Agro-tourism

                McIntyre relates the ship schedule and route for the S.S. Northwestern and spending time with the Purser's 
                sister in the Ketchikan area. He discusses pictures received from Gladys, and details specifications of the Northwestern compared 
                to the Santa Clara. McIntyre recounts two auto accidents in the Seattle area and reflects on their meaning for him.

                ALS. Two loose sheets of dirty white Alaska Steamship Company letterhead stationery 
                measuring 10.875 inches by 8.5 inches, with light blue horizontal lining on the recto 
                beginning 2.75 inches from the top and spaced .375 inches apart. Above the 
                lining, centered at the top of the page, and measuring 4.25 inches by .25 inches is 
                "Alaska Steamship Company", below which and right-justified is a solid black line 
                interrupted by "190" for the date of composition. Measuring approximately 1 inch 
                by 1 inch at the top left corner of the recto is the Alaska Steamship Company 
                logo, reading "Alaska | Steamship Co. | Black Ball | Line" over a black sphere in front 
                of a staff and flag with a black circle centered on a white background. At the extreme 
                top left of the recto, in small block text, is "form 1 10m 8-09". A variably and 
                transversally placed watermark is visible on the right side of the recto, reading 
                "Shawano | Mills". The watermark is variably and horizontally truncated by the 
                right edge of the recto through "Shawano", which measures roughly 5 inches 
                horizontally and would measure 1 inch vertically if the letters were not truncated. 
                "Mills" measures roughly 3 inches by 1 inch.

              A tramp engineer has little formal training, learns on the job, and frequently moves from job to job. 
              In <title level="j">The Engineers' Review</title> volume 16 (1905), I. C. Lloyd defends the tramp 
              engineer as competent compared to the the traditional worker allied to one or two jobs, even 
              though the tramp engineer also <q>won't work in a place long enough to get married to the job. 
              They like new scenes and experiences and won't take back talk from anybody</q> <bibl>
              <ref target="#ICL">Lloyd 18</ref></bibl>. The context of McIntyre's statement suggests that 
              <hi rend="italics">he</hi> is (and has been) the tramp engineer. In his letter to Gladys of 13 August 1909, 
              he asks the company's superintendent engineer to transfer from the <name type="ship">Santa Clara</name> to the <name type="ship">Northwestern</name>. 
              Later in the current letter (04 October 1909), he details the number of the <name type="ship">Santa Clara</name>'s 
              engineering crew, and he exhibits at least a neophyte familiarity with technical specifications and boiler operation.

              Here McIntyre seems to be referring to the boat on which he's currently sailing to catch up 
              with the Northwestern. The diminutive connotation fits with the boastful tone that he has 
              assumed to impress Gladys with the size and power of the Northwestern. Interestingly, the 
              term <hi rend="italics">soap box</hi> hasn't yet entered common usage as a way of designating a smaller, unpowered 
              or low-power vehicle. It's possible that the "soap box" is a lightboat, which appears in the
